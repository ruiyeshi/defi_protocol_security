Shortly after the incident, the attacker—apparently rushing to liquidate before the token price dropped further or exchanges could freeze the assets—accidentally approved a phishing contract. As a result, approximately 542 million UXLINK tokens were transferred to a phishing address.</p>

According to Seedify’s official account, a DPRK-affiliated group known for multiple Web3 exploits gained access to a developer’s private key. Using this access, the attackers were able to mint a large number of SFUND tokens through a bridge contract that had previously passed audit.

As a result, the OFT contract was compromised, allowing the attackers to alter its settings and mint unauthorized tokens on Avalanche.</p>

                    <p><em>Description of the event: </em>Kame Aggregator suffered an exploit due to a design flaw in the swap() function, which allowed arbitrary executor calls. This vulnerability enabled attackers to transfer tokens authorized to the AggregationRouter by users, particularly those with unlimited or oversized approvals.

                    <p><em>Description of the event: </em>According to an announcement from Equilibria Finance, a vulnerability was discovered in the ePENDLE auto-compounder contract on Ethereum, resulting in a loss of approximately 13.36 ETH.

The issue stemmed from the stk-ePENDLE contract on Ethereum mainnet not being configured as non-transferable. The attacker used flash loans via Balancer to acquire ePENDLE, staked it into stk-ePENDLE, and then repeatedly transferred stk-ePENDLE across multiple addresses. Each transfer triggered a reward claim, enabling the attacker to drain the unclaimed rewards from the contract.</p>
