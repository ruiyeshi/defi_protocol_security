    "text": "SBI Crypto-Mining-Rekt\nSix months afterpositioning itself as the white knight rescuing DMM Bitcoin's customersafter a$308 million North Korean hack, SBI Crypto discovered that playing savior doesn't grant immunity from the same attackers.\nSeptember 24th turned into a$24 million disappearing act across five blockchainswhile Japan's \"safe and secure\" mining giant marketed its stability to institutional clients.\nBy the timeZachXBT flagged the bleeding on October 1st, the funds had already hopscotched through instant exchanges and vanished into Tornado Cash's digital fog.\nSBI's response?A corporate haiku of non-information two days later, confirming an \"unauthorized outflow\" while promising only a \"minor impact\" on consolidated results.\nNo explanation of how. No details of when they noticed. No acknowledgment that their mining subsidiary's treasury was drained using an attack pattern reminiscent of the DMM Bitcoin compromise they'd recently absorbed.\nMeanwhile, thoseDMM Bitcoin customers transferring to SBI's platform in March 2025must be wondering: when you escape one sinking ship for another that's already taking on water, who's really getting rescued?\nSeptember 24th, 2025: Addresses linked to SBI Crypto started hemorrhaging across five blockchains - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\nNobody noticed.\nFor a solid week, roughly $24 million sat in laundering limbo while SBI Crypto's mining operations hummed along undisturbed, producing blocks as if nothing had happened.\nOctober 1st brought the reckoning when blockchain detectiveZachXBT dropped his findings on Telegram: coordinated outflows, instant exchange routing, final destination Tornado Cash.\nSBI Crypto operates as a mining pool subsidiary under SBI Holdings, Japan's publicly traded financial giant with Prime Market listing and institutional ambitions to match.\nDespite theiralmost 20 EH/S Hashrate- ranking them12th globally among mining pools- andover 21% of Bitcoin Cash's computing share, the company had maintained complete radio silence.\nHours stretched into days while the crypto community watched funds that had already been laundered.\nZachXBT's Telegram post noted several indicators sharing similarities with known DPRK attacks- the instant exchange routing, the Tornado Cash endpoint, the multi-chain coordination.\nZach creditedCyverswithhelping the investigation, confirming what the blockchain was screaming: this wasn't amateur hour.\nSeven days after the theft, with the evidence already public and the money already gone, how long does it take a publicly traded financial giant to acknowledge they've been robbed?\nOctober 2nd finally broughtSBI Holdings' response: \"Notice Regarding the Unauthorized Outflow of Crypto Assets at SBI Crypto Co., Ltd.\"\nThe headline promised information. The content delivered corporate fog.\nSBI Holdings confirmed an \"unauthorized outflow of crypto assets owned as its own assets\" at their mining subsidiary.\nThey were \"conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the incident and the amount of assets that were lost.\"\nTranslation: we got drained, we're not sure how, and we're still counting the damage.\nThe statement assured customersthe impact on consolidated financial results would be \"minor\" - a curious claim for a company that hadn't finished tallying what disappeared.\nMore importantly,SBI VC Tradeand BITPoint Japan, the domestic exchange arms, remained untouched. Customer funds safe, no unauthorized outflows, business as usual.\nThat last part mattered because just ten months earlier,SBI VC Trade had positioned itself as the new home for DMM Bitcoin's customersafter their$308 million North Korean hack.\nNow SBI's mining subsidiary was bleeding funds through what looked suspiciously like the same attack pattern.\nThe statement closed with a vague mention of \"possible business restructuring going forward\" for SBI Crypto's operations.\nRestructuring? The mining pool that just got gutted might need more than a corporate reorganization chart.\nWhatSBI's statementdidn't mention proved more interesting than what it did: no explanation of the attack vector, no timeline of detection, no acknowledgment that their \"thorough investigation\" was seven days late to a party blockchain sleuths had already documented.\nWhen your “disclosure” consists of confirming what everyone already knew, skipping the questions that actually matter, what is SBI even investigating?\nSeptember 24th's coordinated drain spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash - a multi-chain operation that required either extensive preparation or intimate knowledge of SBI Crypto's wallet infrastructure.\nMaybe both.\nThe theft addresses tell the story of a systematic extraction:\nEthereum:0x40d76a78ddba2ea81fb0f9fba147a08bcfc2b866\nBitcoin:bc1qx0a2kfjd7eweczv8xqjm6rggm40v0nkhfss78l\nBitcoin Cash:qpv9nh5ktagsmtkqle8z2w4dd3mksskpmy499z7c9k\nLitecoin:ltc1qjyrn9p803efj3p8a0g3fmlevs45kq704ns363t\nDogecoin:DRiEQuJ9pt3GgNraQmHVTjNg4B7uv1XuGb\nRoughly $24 million vanished across these five walletsin movements timed close enough to suggest coordination, distant enough to avoid triggering automated security alerts that might have been watching for simultaneous drains.\nMining pools may hold cryptocurrency in hot wallets for operational needs - collected block rewards, accumulated earnings, liquidity for transactions.\nSBI Crypto's pool-level wallets became the target.\nEvery day, millions flow through hot wallets kept online for operational needs.\nPredictable money, accessible wallets, multiple external touchpoints.\nAttackers don't usually guess which wallets hold the treasury across five different blockchains.\nSomeone knew exactly where SBI Crypto kept their funds, which chains to hit, and which addresses controlled the liquidity.\nReconnaissance that thorough takes time. Or they already had the map.\nDid someone spend weeks mapping SBI's wallet architecture, or did they already have the blueprint?\nSeptember 24th: Five blockchains drained simultaneously, funds moving before anyone noticed the breach.\nStarting with Ethereum.\nAttacker’s Wallet on Ethereum:0x40d76a78ddba2ea81fb0f9fba147a08bcfc2b866\n$6.4 million stolen from SBI Crypto's pool address (labeled on Arkham):0x9f25779098c5632da2ec55d161c4e5f2afc4e0ec\nThe systematic splits started immediately.\n1,443 ETH movedto the following laundering address:0xd2C8EDe41fb84d18353A7ABBcf6448f2E6B664e0\nFrom there:924 ETH to Tornado Cashacross 15 separate transactions. 30 ETH to SideShift instant exchange in two 15 ETH batches.\nThen came the audacious move:246 ETH cycled backthrough SBI Crypto's own address beforerouting to OpenOcean DEXusing Rabby wallet. Using the victim's infrastructure to launder their own stolen funds.\nTotal Stolen on Ethereum:$6.4 million\nBut most of the damage was done on Bitcoin.\nAttacker’s Address on Bitcoin:bc1qx0a2kfjd7eweczv8xqjm6rggm40v0nkhfss78l\n$17.45 million drained from multiple SBI wallets (labeled by Arkham):bc1qte0s6pz7gsdlqq2cf6hv5mxcfksykyyyjkdfd5bc1qrpp7g75sx3ejclvsfdw2uahzchtyu7vumkuadubc1q8uyg2xpp6vjlmn0g5c9kujr7scm4hry5g67uqebc1qe2esaxek04jx7vn2eelu4u7fee90cd6nh09dhn\n143.2 BTC is sitting thereas of October 3rd. Visible. Untouched. Waiting.\nEither the attackers are playing the long game, waiting for heat to die down, or moving that much Bitcoin draws attention they're not ready for yet.\nThings got a little more tricky for the other 3 chains.\nStarting with Bitcoin Cash.\nAttacker's Wallet on Bitcoin Cash:qpv9nh5ktagsmtkqle8z2w4dd3mksskpmy499z7c9k\n126.56 BCH stolenfrom SBI Crypto's wallet (not labeled by Arkham):qqzxuj5qvglktpq49v2wrg790a935z3cyssnfg4n4x\nImmediately splitbetween two addresses - 25.56 BCH to one, 101 BCH to another.\nThen the money hopped. And hopped. And hopped again.\nThe 101 BCH batch fractured through endless two-way splits - a little to one address, most to another, repeat. Each hop whittled down the amount through trading fees and obfuscation costs.\nAs of October 3rd, the funds were still being transferred every few hours.\nTotal Stolen on Bitcoin Cash:$67,874\nOn to Litecoin…\nAttacker's Wallet on Litecoin:ltc1qjyrn9p803efj3p8a0g3fmlevs45kq704ns363t\n719 LTC stolen from two SBI Crypto wallets (not labeled on Arkham):ltc1qczll7dppteakes3drx004e86um85pwvzzwwpyqltc1qn9hdc32jakpyavtnujvr7k08acwh8sg8qywjcy\nThe theft came in two waves:504 LTCfrom the first wallet.214 LTCfrom the second, assembled from multiple smaller batches.\nThen thesplits began: 119 LTC to one address, 385 LTC to another.\nMultiple hops followed, each designed to fragment the trail.\nTotal Stolen on Litecoin:$76,343\nFinally on to Dogecoin.\nAttacker's Wallet on Dogecoin:DRiEQuJ9pt3GgNraQmHVTjNg4B7uv1XuGb\n~180K DOGE drained from SBI Crypto's wallet (as labeled by Arkham):DJJ9Rdcuama5GEjJo2oYfeKdvQEXA54BVL\nThe theft happened in two separate waves:\nFirst:92,115 DOGESecond:87,893 DOGE\nThe funds then routed through a cluster of FixedFloat exchange addresses - each transfer splitting the amount further, each hop making the money harder to follow.\nTotal Stolen on Dogecoin:$42,718\nTotal Stolen across all 5 chains:~ $24 million\nWhile some of these wallets lack Arkham labels (Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin), blockchain forensics confirm they were drained in the September 24th attack.\nSomeone calculated exactly how to split the haul - large enough to be worth moving, small enough to slip past automated monitoring thresholds.\nEvery swap used sophisticated routing. Every split followed a pattern. Every move suggested experience with exactly this kind of operation.\nThe attackers understood DeFi infrastructure well enough to extract maximum value while minimizing on-chain exposure.\nThey knew which aggregators offered the best rates. They knew which protocols provided privacy features. They knew how to break large sums into pieces that wouldn't trigger automated monitoring.\nBy the time the funds hit instant exchanges - those sketch platforms that swap crypto for crypto with minimal KYC - the trail had been sufficiently obscured through multiple wallets and protocol hops.\nThe entire laundering operation took hours for some chains, days for others. Different strategies per asset - speed and sophistication for Ethereum, patience for Bitcoin, maximum fragmentation for the rest.\nProfessional execution - enough crumbs for sleuths to follow, none for anyone to get the money back.\nWhen your attackers demonstrate better operational discipline than your security infrastructure, what does that say about whose operation runs more professionally?\nThe forensics showed what happened. The blockchain recorded every move.\nBut one key element is missing from this story. How did they get in?\nSBI Holdings confirmed the unauthorized outflowbut skipped the most important part: how did attackers drain wallets across five different blockchains?\nTwo possibilities emerge from their silence, both embarrassing for a company marketing institutional-grade security.\nSomeone got the keys. Hot wallet private keys mean total control - no approvals needed, no exploit chains required. You have the key, you own the wallet.\nPrivate key compromisesgrabbed 43.8% of stolen crypto in 2024for a reason: simplicity wins.\nKeys leak a hundred different ways. Phishing emails. Malware. Keyloggers recording every keystroke. Plaintext files saved to cloud storage. Vendors with too much access.\nOne weak link anywhere in the chain, and $24 million walks out the door.\nEvenTayvano was sending out warning signs, “begging you to stop updating your zoom sdk it doesn’t update your sdk it’s just malware.\"\nSBI Crypto knows vendor problems.\nTheyfiled a lawsuit against Whinstone US back in 2023for fraud and negligence after the Texas facilitydelivered corroded, dusty mining equipment missing basic filters.\nThat lawsuit showed SBI's appetite for trusting partners who fail to deliver.\nTrust the wrong vendor with wallet infrastructure, security becomes their problem to lose.\nOr maybe attackers never needed the keys.\nSupply chain attacks target the infrastructure itself - production servers, account logic, security controls.\nBigONE got hit this way in Julywhen hackers modified their risk control servers.\nSwissBorg watched their staking partner Kiln's API get compromised in September, burying authorization instructions inside routine transactions before draining $41.5 million.\nSuspicious timing:September 2025 saw SBI's Zodia Custody joint venture collapsethe same month as the mining pool hack.\nCustody venture folds, mining operation bleeds millions, thirty days apart.\nWhinstone lawsuit. DMM Bitcoin absorption. Zodia dissolution. And now this theft.\nSBI's track record keeps circling back to partnerships that explode.\nZachXBT spotted the tell-tale signs- instant exchanges, Tornado Cash, multi-chain coordination.\nClassic DPRK moves. Lazarus Group wrote the playbook for both attack types.\nThey've social engineered their way to private keys, whichoften involves targeting developers and employees with lucrative job opportunitiesto plant malicious scripts disguised as employment tests.\nDMM Bitcoin died that wayin May 2024.\nNorth Korean operative posed as a recruiter,targeted a Ginco employee managing DMM's wallets, posing as a recruiter and sending them a URL to a malicious Python script hosted on GitHub as part of a supposed pre-employment test.\nThe script was uploaded to GitHub, exploited later, then poof….$308 million gone.\nSix months after SBI absorbed those DMM victims, their mining arm gets drained using similar tactics.\nEither DPRK recognized another soft target or they never left town after the first job.\nSBI won't say which scenario played out. Private keys or infrastructure?\nInside job or external breach?\nTheir silence suggests either active law enforcement cooperation or embarrassment too deep to acknowledge publicly.\nMining pools manage predictable flows with known patterns.\nHitting five blockchains simultaneously requires either extensive reconnaissance or inside knowledge.\nSomeone spent time studying SBI's architecture or already had the map.\nWe're guessing because SBI decided \"unauthorized outflow\" constituted sufficient disclosure for a publicly traded company managing institutional infrastructure.\nWhen your corporate transparency falls below the public blockchain recording your theft, whose investigation deserves trust?\nSBI Crypto joined an expensive club nobody wants membership in: Japanese crypto companies that marketed security while hemorrhaging funds to North Korean hackers.\n$24 million vanished through operational failures SBI refuses to explain, using attack patterns matching the same threat actors who destroyed the exchange they'd just absorbed.\nThe company that positioned itself as DMM Bitcoin's savior got owned by what looks suspiciously like DMM's executioners, then responded with corporate statements so vague they could've been auto-generated.\nSeptember's Zodia Custody collapse, followed immediately by the mining pool drain, suggests problems deeper than a single breach.\nSBI's pattern reads consistent: trust partners, get burned, litigate or acquire the wreckage, repeat.\nWhether attackers stole private keys or compromised infrastructure remains SBI's secret.\nTheir silence protects either an ongoing investigation or reputational damage too severe to acknowledge.\nMining pools managing institutional flows across five blockchains don't usually get systematically drained without inside knowledge or extensive reconnaissance - someone either studied SBI's architecture for months or already had the blueprint.\nThose DMM Bitcoin customers who transferred to SBI's \"secure\" platform in March now occupy the uncomfortable position of trusting a company that couldn't protect its own treasury six months after marketing itself on security credentials.\nWhen the white knight's armor turns out to be rented, and the castle they're defending has unguarded backdoors, who exactly got rescued?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

    "text": "Bug Bounties-Defi\nA $730,000 hack just proved that ChatGPT is a better security auditor than most protocols.\nSuperRare's staking contract contained a vulnerability so basicthat OpenAI's chatbot could spot it instantly.\nThe logic error was sitting there in plain sight - a simple access control bug that unit tests would have caught, that any bug bounty program worth its salt would have flagged, that even the most cursory security review should have detected.\nInstead, SuperRare had no public bug bounty program in place, betting that their smart contracts were bulletproof.\nThey weren't.\nWhile SuperRare represents the extreme end of penny-pinching security, the broader industry isn't much better.\nCertain platforms arelinking their cheapest service tiers to maximum bounty payouts, often limiting rewards to just $50,000.\nIf that’s what happens when bounties are skipped, here’s what happens when they’re capped.\nCork Protocol's $100,000 bounty capcouldn't prevent a $12 million hack.\nThe economic incentives have flipped: exploitation now pays orders of magnitude more than disclosure.\nSecurity researchers are getting the message loud and clear.\nWhen finding vulnerabilities pays less than exploiting them, the choice becomes obvious.\nHow did an industry built on cryptographic certainty decide that uncertainty was cheaper?\nThe numbers don't lie, but they do tell a story nobody wants to hear.\nCrypto just posted numbers that would make a casino blush.\nBy mid-2025, $2 billion was lost across dozens of incidents according to theChainalysis Mid-year report.\nThat's already more than all of 2024's losses, and we're not even done yet.\nAugust added another $163 million across 16 breaches- because apparently nobody got the memo from July's $142 million wake-up call.\nEach hack follows the same script: protocols pinch pennies on security, then act shocked when someone finds the vulnerabilities they refused to pay for.\nGMX's legacy V1 contracts wereexploited for roughly $42 million in July 2025via a re-entrancy bug; public reporting does not specify whether those legacy contracts remained in scope of GMX’s pre-incident bounty program.\nKiloEx lost $7.5 millionto what security researchers called a \"basic Oracle 101 exploit\" - the kind of manipulation that proper incentives should have caught months earlier.\nBut here's where the story gets interesting: both protocols immediately offered 10% recovery bounties worth millions to get their funds back.\nGMX's post-hackbounty kept by the attacker was $5 million.\nKiloEx's attacker accepted their 10% recovery bounty of $750kand returned the stolen funds.\nIf they had enough money available for recovery bounties, where were those funds when it came to prevention?\nAcademic researchers just delivered the industry's most uncomfortable wake-up call.\nA comprehensive study of smart contract upgradesuncovered 31,407 potential security issues across 83,085 upgraded contracts.\nThat's not a typo - over thirty-one thousand problems sitting in production code, handling billions in user funds.\nBut here's the part that should make every protocol team squirm:the study identified eight risk categories, several of which remain under-recognized or poorly mitigated in practice to the community.\nThe study found several vulnerability categories that appear to be under-recognized and lacking clear mitigation strategies.\nThe paper reads like a laundry listof industry negligence.\nProtocols routinely mark critical components as \"out of scope\" during audits, then act surprised when attackers ignore those convenient boundaries.\nAnalysis of major exploits showscritical components often fall outside audit scope, with theexploited Cork Protocol components being a case in pointwhere scope gaps enabled the attack that eventually got exploited.\n\"Out of scope\" has become the industry's favorite magic words.\nCan't audit everything? Just draw some arbitrary lines and hope attackers respect the boundaries.\nThey don't.\nHow did \"we didn't look at that part\" become an acceptable answer for billion-dollar security audits?\nMitchell Amador saw this comingfrom a mile away.\nThe Immunefi CEOhas been beating the drum about incentive alignment, watching platforms trip over the same economic fallacy again and again.\nHis thesis is brutally simple: crypto security isn't about code quality - it's about making disclosure more profitable than exploitation.\nThe \"scaling standard\" should put bounties at roughly 10% of funds at risk.\nProtecting $10 million? Offer up to $1 million.\nThese aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet - they're life-changing incentives that keep researchers on the right side of the fence.\nInstead, platforms are racing toward the bottom.\nSome platforms tie their cheapest service tiers to capped bounty payouts -sometimes as low as $50,000, according to Amador’s commentary.\nThat bet keeps losing.\nExperts argued SuperRare’s $730,000 loss was trivially preventableand likely would have been caught by a routine bounty program or standard unit tests.\nCork Protocol's public bounty topped out at $100,000 via Cantina- the exploit netted about $12 million on May 28, 2025.\nThe math was never hard - why spend hundreds of hours finding a vulnerability for a capped payout that's 120 times smaller than the exploit value?\nBut platforms keep doubling down on discount security,creating what Amador calls\"a death spiral that benefits no one except malicious actors.\"\nMeanwhile, the few protocols that actually get it are proving the model works - and showing everyone else what they're missing.\nWhat does proper security incentivization actually look like when someone decides to spend the money?\nLayerZerodidn't mess around when theylaunched their $15 million bug bounty programin 2023,partnering with Immunefi.\nThe message was crystal clear: find our vulnerabilities and get rewarded handsomely.\nThe program works because the economics make sense.\nLayerZero handles large volumes in cross-chain transactions- $15 million isn't generosity; it's risk-scaled insurance.\nBy offering one of the largest crypto bug bounty pools ever, they aligned incentives so that disclosure became far more profitable than exploitation.It is still active as of today too.\nEuler Financelearned this lesson the expensive way.\nAfter losing $197 million in their 2023 flash loan attack, they didn't just rebuild - they transformed their entire approach to security.\nTheir original $1 million bounty programevolved into a$7.5 million powerhouse hosted on Cantina, with comprehensive scope that covers the components other protocols love marking \"out of scope.\"\nMakerDAO set the standard in 2022 with their $10 million program, proving that meaningful security requires meaningful incentives.\nThe protocol has since rebranded to Sky,continuing its robust bug bounty program on Immunefiwith the same $10 million maximum reward, now covering the SKY governance ecosystem and the USDS stablecoin.\nWormhole paid out $10 million in 2022for a single critical vulnerability discovery - the largest crypto bug bounty on record at the time - andcontinues to maintain an active bug bounty program today, with a current maximum reward of $5 million.\nThese aren't feel-good PR stunts. They're economic warfare against exploitation, making it more profitable to help than to harm.\nImmunefi's track record backs up the thesis: over $120 million paid out in bounties, $25+ billion in user funds protected.\nWhen the incentives align, the system works.\nSo why are most protocols still playing with monopoly money while handling real billions?\nWhen being cheap on security costs more than being expensive, what exactly are these protocols optimizing for?\nTurns out, they're optimizing for the wrong metrics entirely.\nMarket competition warped the incentives in the worst possible way.\nPlatforms started treating bug bounties like line items to be minimized rather than insurance policies that need to scale.\nSome tied their rock-bottom service plans to equally pathetic bounty caps, creating a race to the bottom where protocols choose cheaper packages not because the risk is lower, but because the pricing encourages it.\nThis is where the industry's understanding of bug bounties went completely sideways.\nThese aren't expenses - they're the cost of staying in business.\nBut when platforms compete on price instead of security outcomes, something has to give.\nAnd what gave was the social contract that keeps skilled researchers hunting for vulnerabilities instead of exploiting them.\nThe result? Researchers started making rational economic decisions.\nWhy grind through hundreds of hours of code review for a $50,000 cap when the same vulnerability might be worth millions to exploit? Some researchers quit public programs entirely.\nOthers shifted to private audits where the pay actually matches the effort.\nThe rest just went dark.\nThe industry created its own brain drain, then acted confused when the exploits started piling up.\nWe've seen this movie before in Web2, where chronic underpayment and poor researcher treatmentled to a mass exodus from public bug bounty programs.\nCrypto can't afford the same mistake - not when trillions in institutional money are preparing to go onchain and regulators are watching every move.\nBut instead of learning from history, most protocols doubled down on discount security, creating what one researcher called \"a chilling effect where everyone loses except the attackers.\"\nThe math was always going to catch up eventually. The only question was how much it would cost when it did.\nHow much damage can the industry absorb before someone admits that cheap security is the most expensive choice of all?\nThe bill always comes due.\nThe attackers have already done the math for everyone else.\nThey know exactly what protocols are worth, what their security budgets look like, and how much it costs to find the vulnerabilities everyone else refuses to pay for.\nMeanwhile, protocols keep burning through users' funds, then scrambling to explain why their discount security wasn't quite good enough.\nThe recovery bounty theater proves they always had the money - they just chose to spend it on damage control instead of damage prevention.\nSuperRare, Cork Protocol, GMX, KiloEx - the pattern is identical across different chains, different vulnerabilities, different attack vectors.\nThe only constant is the false economy of treating security like an optional expense instead of the price of admission to handle other people's money.\nAcademic researchers found over 31,000 security issues sitting in production code, most with zero mitigation.\nBug bounty platforms report record payouts while hack losses hit record highs.\nIf the industry that invented \"don't trust, verify\" can't figure out how to verify its own security, what exactly is all that blockchain immutability protecting?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

About 22m.\"\nThe real Bruce Lee wrote about \"stick ability or stoppage\" - when the mind stops and loses its mobility in combat.\nThis Bruce Lee had achieved the ultimate stoppage: his proxy contract's mind had stopped so completely that77.098 million MATIC worth $20 millionas of press time, became as immovable as a statue.\nWhere the master philosopher sought to avoid mental rigidity, this digital disaster had created the most rigid situation possible - funds frozen in perpetual ice.\nHis problem wasn't complex: a proxy upgrade had set the wrong implementation contract, wiping out admin and upgrade roles like a bad martial arts movie where the hero forgets all his moves at the crucial moment.\nHow do you explain to 77 million POL worth of presale investors that your proxy upgrade just pulled a reverse Bruce Lee - instead of flowing like water, it froze like concrete?\nYannickCrypto had seen enough carnage todeliver his investigation via Twitter:\"I guess @JUDAOGlobal (not sure if its them) made a presale and collected 77 MILLION POL.

Pooofff $22,000,000 gone.\"\nYannickCrypto later hintedat the forensic breadcrumb that led to this tentative identification - the kind of careful detective work that makes security researchers invaluable to the crypto ecosystem.\nThe tentative attribution came froma single cryptic Twitter replythat had instructions for the account opening process, and listed the following as a \"Vault\" address:\n0x7D341e757f893e1a13D40370d0F6065ca9c4777E\nThe project haddeployed a proxy contractthat ended up holding millions in POL tokens.\nWho exactly got rekt here remains a mystery - the anonymous nature of the project means presale participants likely still don't know what happened to their funds.\nInstead of revolutionary DeFi, they got revolutionary incompetence.\nBut who was behind the wheel when this digital disaster struck?\n\"Can you delete this post?\"Bruce Lee beggedin the Telegram,desperation dripping from every character: \"That is a bad news for our users.\"\nYannickCrypto's responsewas swift and merciless: \"bro you locked ALL FUNDS of your users, you have other problems.\"\nAs dawn broke, the community's diagnosis became increasingly brutal.\nUnder mounting pressure,Bruce Lee eventually attempted to deflect responsibility: \"Not me. The prev dev, he is too tired when upgrading this contract.Set a wrong contract.\"\nThe classic move - blame the previous developer.\nAccording to the fake Bruce Lee's version of events, some exhausted predecessor had botched the proxy upgrade by setting the wrong implementation address, wiping out all admin privileges in the process.\nWhether this mysterious \"prev dev\" actually existed or was just a convenient scapegoat remained unclear.\nYannickCrypto's explanationwas zen-like in its simplicity: \"I mean the dev was tired.\"\nThe roasting had reached terminal velocity.\n\"Launch a memecoin maybe ppl will buy your story,\"one person suggested.\nAnother chimed in: \"Slerf?\" - referring to theinfamous Solana disasterwhere a developer accidentally burned millions by clicking the wrong button.\nHours later, as the Ethereum Security Telegram continued dissecting the disaster,Mudit Gupta proposed the ultimate tongue in cheek Hail Mary: \"What if they created a governance proposal for pol staker, bribing them to recover the funds.\"\n\"Pol wars,\"came the reply.\nFat chance. Getting Polygon governance to fork the network for anunidentified projectthis incompetent would be like asking Bruce Lee to resurrect himself just to teach basic smart contract security.\nThe silence that followed spoke volumes about the mystery project's prospects for recovery.\nHow do you explain that someone named Bruce Lee got knocked out by his own incompetence?\nTrue mastery transcends any particular art, Bruce Lee once wrote.\nWhatever project was behind this disaster mastered the art of vanishing without a trace.\nNo public statement, no blog post explaining the disaster, no recovery roadmap - just radio silence punctuated by the sound of over $20 million hitting the digital equivalent of concrete.\nIt does not help that the user named Bruce Lee did not identify his project, besides dropping a contract address:\n0x7D341e757f893e1a13D40370d0F6065ca9c4777E\nWhile their legendary namesake taught that \"the spirit harbors nothing in it\" to achieve perfect responsiveness, this Bruce Lee had achieved something more impressive: a spirit that harbored absolutely nothing, including responsibility for the mess he created.\nThe real Bruce Lee wrote about achieving \"purposelessness\" through disciplined training.\nThis Bruce Lee achieved purposelessness by writing purposeless code that turnedover $20 million worth of POLinto the world's most expensive screensaver.\nHis proxy upgrade created the ultimate digital art installation, perfectly preserved behind unbreakable smart contract glass, viewable by all, touchable by none.\nThe mystery deepens with each passing day.\nCould it beJudao Global?\nAs security researcher Zilayo noted,JUDAO appears to be a complete black box.\nTheirTwitter pageis bare bones, not much activity lately, no way to reach them, no acknowledgment that millions in user funds are permanently locked. So hard to tell if it actually them.\nRekt News reached out toJuCoin Labs,whoannounced a partnership with JUDAO, but received no response.\nBut plot twist time: what if this wasn't just garden-variety incompetence?\nThe whole setup reeks of something fishier than a week-old sushi buffet.\nMaybe user funds were never supposed to make it back out alive, and our wannabe Bruce Lee accidentally locked himself out of his own con.\nWhatever project lies behind this disaster has achieved something remarkable: a spirit that harbors absolutely nothing, including responsibility for the mess they created.\nIf this was indeed a presale operation, participants likely remain completely unaware their funds are frozen forever, still waiting for tokens that will never arrive.\nTheaddress currently sits unlabeled on Arkham, holding over $20 million in POL with nothing but \"Fundpool (Proxy)\" as identification.\nSomeone out there knows who's behind this mess.\nIf anyone can definitively identify this project or has information about the locked funds, drop the crypto community a line - we'd love to properly label one of 2025's most expensive screw ups.\nBut seriously, who got rugged here? The anonymous project creators, the clueless presale participants, or the Temu version of Bruce Lee?\nWhen your greatest achievement is accidentally rugpulling yourself, have you mastered the art of failure or just proven that some dragons should never have left their cave?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

That's how long it took forUXLINK to admit they'd been cleaned out, finally posting the corporate equivalent of \"oops, someone robbed us.\"\n\"We have identified a security breach involving our multi-signature wallet, resulting in a significant amount of cryptocurrency being illicitly transferred to both CEXs and DEXs.\"\nBut this wasn't your typical flash loan exploit or price manipulation masterpiece - this was administrative betrayal wrapped in smart contract jargon.\nWhen your emergency response time is longer than a Netflix episode, what exactly are you protecting users from?\nUXLINK's multisig wasn't hacked - it was hijacked.\nNo complex DeFi jujitsu. Someone with admin access just decided the treasury belonged to them now.\nThe delegateCall came first- blockchain's version of changing all the locks while everyone's asleep.\nOne function call to boot the old admins, another to install themselves as the new bossvia addOwnerWithThreshold.\nThe contract didn't know the difference between legitimate governance and a hostile takeover - it just followed orders from whoever held the admin keys.\nThis was administrative betrayal wrapped in smart contract jargon.\nWhen your security model assumes the people with access won't rob you blind, what happens when they do exactly that?\nThe digital footprints tell an ugly story.\nStarting with this attacker’s address taking complete control of UXLINK's treasury:0x2EF43c1D0c88C071d242B6c2D0430e1751607B87\nThen ~$18 million walked out the door across several chains - the seed money for what would become a much larger operation.\nBlockscopesecurity researcherGangsterhomehelped provide the forensics breakdown to Rekt News.\nThe initial attack transactions are as follows…\nOn Ethereum Mainnet:\n25.27 ETH ($105k):0x618e914f8c0afccaaf9be2d502730aa9c89f6cb0cc63aa6e700ef7e1d659b093\n$2.68M USDT:0x725a490ee5cd49209b08cf5b7e7513656098d1c174acdf006707b2d5589654bd\n$1.3M USDT:0x30c72951bce511d4b189844ef750b69fe07d9b78817167ae3ec28628860c2989\n3.7 wBTC ($420k):0x00de60732cb5ca53ad2ac0a2babdc63f94239645309ee097dddb7ed350a1f7e7\n$1.45M USDT:0x278bfd667d9d3e55a33f9255457b3cd4522b96294de4fdc8b79583835491e63c\n$500K USDC:0xf8dce9dfe0ef189b5fe7ad4cded7ef1e4bfffd6955dc1fcd8f3c2b7259afc650\n$123K USDT:0xc609ec7be6274c513fadfb6a95e009b395fd3c4805e81f4896e7ebd89d38dddd\nTotal stolen on Ethereum through the initial theft address:$6.578 Million.\nThe stolen funds from above were sent here:0x6385eb73faE34bF90Ed4c3d4c8aFBC957FF4121C\nThen some of the funds were swapped and transferred here:0xaC77B44A5F3acC54E3844A609fffd64F182ef931\nInitial theft address you say? Because the damage is worse than initially reported.\nAnother address did almost twice the damage on Ethereum Mainnet around the same time in several transactions:0xb819e6ae5a6668bb0ce02d64d130deca9ff83691\nWhat was stolen on Eth Mainnet in Round 2:\n$5.382 million DAI\n$1.377 million USDT\n4.009 million USDC\n4.7327032 WBTC ($538k)\nTotal from this theft:$11.3 Million\nView the 2nd exploit transaction tracing on Ethereum on Metasleuth here:UXLink 2nd Ethereum Exploit\nTotal theft on Ethereum:$17.885 Million\nMeanwhile on BSC, smaller amounts were stolen.\nBSC theft totals:19.5k KiloEx -

the real payday came from infinite mints and multi-chain laundering.\nThe real show started when the attacker discovered they could print money.\nMint transactions began flowing like water.\nUXLINK broke the news themselves: \"We have identified an unauthorized minting of UXLINK tokens today by a malicious actor.\"\nThe first 1 billion UXLINK tokens were minted in this transaction:0x35edac40767f65d4d1382f0f55cda2f4db321313e16fe059079f0113f9cb5696\nPeckShield flaggedthe UXLink token with \"DO NOT TRADE\" warnings.\nThen came the second billion in this mint:0x2466caf408248d1b6fc6fd9d7ec8eb8d8e70cab52dacff1f94b056c10f253bc2\nPeckShield flagged the second mint too, whileHacken piled on with estimates that the attacker created almost 10 trillion tokens total, with continued minting tracked throughout the day.\nBy the time all the security firms were sounding alarms, the attacker had turned UXLINK's carefully planned tokenomics into hyperinflationary chaos.\nBlockscope's forensics applied a lot of elbow grease and revealed the scope: roughly 6,700 ETH (~$26.8 million) moved from Arbitrum to Ethereum through sophisticated cross-chain operations usingAcross ProtocolandDefiway.\nThe attacker used multiple unlabeled wallets to systematically mint billions of UXLINK tokens on Arbitrum.\nSwap them for ETH through DEXs likeCoW Protocol.\nBridge substantial ETH amounts to Ethereum Mainnet.\nThe money trail leads to ten addresses where the exploiter's funds currently sit, maybe waiting for the next move.\nAddresses involved in holding exploiter funds (as tracked by Blockscope):\n0x64ab9377a2b3bbb61dd79f8997e7f8c1cc1a4de8\n0x7277c705b5b1963b602cb4e3ab8e188d925bed00\n0xf35dde49a1bbe7a8883a8f35d48fb33c20a69b39\n0x7e1f34418e2da204a8eabdb29eddf7c09a494a3f\n0x5210bfdf0cfe6471322d597d16cf440f5ac59309\n0xac77b44a5f3acc54e3844a609fffd64f182ef931\n0xd7aa2bd9e9407f682a379bed346088b0849b6434\n0x714dda349ef43326791f923e8389a21d11378c67\n0xa3ce95ac672b62ed75afbe6f50285c28ef717a44\n0xaade027d63ea859a4993961a8a8cc5aae3f020f3\nTotal Operation Scale(As of September 25th):~$41 Million\nBlockscope's comprehensive forensics analysisindicates the attacker ultimately controlled approximately $41 million in realized proceeds from the combined treasury theft and minting operations.\nThis figure represents ongoing analysis of complex multi-chain fund flows and may be subject to revision as additional evidence emerges.\nThe minting wasn't monopoly money - it was a sophisticated multi-chain laundering operation worth tens of millions.\nWhen you can create infinite tokens and successfully convert them to real ETH across multiple chains, who is counting losses and who is laughing?\nSpeaking of laughing and losses.\nWhile the attacker was busy playing central banker with UXLINK's token supply, someone else was watching - and waiting.\nAt 02:15 UTC on September 23rd, cosmic justice arrived in the form of a phishing transaction:0xa70674ccc9caa17d6efaf3f6fcbd5dec40011744c18a1057f391a822f11986ee\nThe UXLINK exploiter had fallen for the oldest trick in the Web3 book - a phishing attack.\nScam Sniffer flagged the cosmic justice- one malicious \"increaseAllowance\" approval and 542 million UXLINK tokens vanished from the attacker's wallet.\nThe tokens landed in addresses linked to Inferno Drainer - the notorious \"draining-as-a-service\" group that turns phishing into an art form.\nSlowMist’s founder Cos, confirmed what some suspected:the exploiter had been exploited by Inferno Drainer.\nEven experienced hackers aren't immune to clicking the wrong link.\nWhat does it say about Web3 security when the people robbing protocols get robbed themselves?\nUXLINK spun into crisis mode, serving corporate speak while working behind the scenes.\nFirst came the boilerplate“we’re working around the clock,” followed by the obligatory promise to call exchanges and freeze funds.\nThen, the pivot to victim-blaming: don’t trade on DEXs, because “unauthorized tokens” are flooding the market.\n“We strongly advise all community members not to trade UXLINK on DEXs at this time, in order to avoid potential losses caused by these unauthorized tokens.”\nTranslation: our token supply is completely screwed, please ignore the trillions of rogue tokens now floating free.\nNext up: the classic “majority of funds frozen” line - corporate code for “some exchanges helped, but most of the money is gone.”\nLaw enforcement got looped in, security experts were called, blockchain forensics firms were hired.\nAnd then came their boldest move yet: a total token swap with a new fixed-supply contract.\nThe plan was simple - abandon the compromised token, start fresh, roll out new tokenomics, and slap a shiny security promise on top.\nJust forget about those 10 trillion unauthorized tokens floating around like digital tumbleweeds.\nUXLINK stated: “We will promptly initiate a token swap plan to ensure the integrity of our token economy.”\nTwo days later, UXLINK rolled out their masterpiece:a shiny new contract that passed security audit, stripped of its mint function, and conveniently relocated to Ethereum instead of the compromised Arbitrum setup.\nTo dress it up, they addedsome regulatory compliance theater- name-dropping Korean authorities and boasting of “frozen hacker addresses”.\nThen came the migration plan. A 1:1 swap that excluded “illegally issued” tokens, but only for “legally issued” tokens. Anon-chain redemption portal would arrive within five working days(from September 24th).\nCirculating supply was fixed at ~479M, based on the whitepaper.\nA follow-up announcementconfirmed the Ethereum Mainnet relaunch with a hard cap of 1B tokens. It detailed both CEX and on-chain swap mechanics, and sketched out the compensation plan.\nFrozen hacker tokens would remain off-limits.But userscaught in the chaos might be reimbursedthrough buybacks, staking perks, or trading incentives - all depending on how much value UXLINK could claw back from the laundering trails.\nMeanwhile,security firm Guardrail AI couldn't resist the\"we could have prevented this\" victory lap,claiming their monitoring would have caught the unauthorized mintingbefore it spiraled into token hyperinflation.\nEasy to be smart after the damage is done.\nWhen your solution to a hack is to delete the entire token and start over, how badly did you mess up the first time?\nUXLINK's $41 million heist serves up a familiar menu of administrative failure with a side of poetic justice.\nUXLINK's token took a 70% nosedivefrom $0.30 to $0.072, wiping$70 million in market capoff the books whiletrading volume surged over 1,320% to $437 millionas panic sellers raced for the exits.\nBut here's what really stings: we may never know exactly how the attacker gained admin access in the first place.\nWas it a phished team member? A malicious insider? Compromised infrastructure?\nUXLINK isn't saying, and maybe never will. Only time and a proper post-mortem can tell.\nCode exploits get detailed post-mortems because protocols want to look smart - \"here's the bug, here's the fix, trust us with your money again.\"\nBut admin key compromises get buried under corporate speak and damage control because admitting your humans are the weakest link doesn't inspire confidence.\nFlash loan attacks teach us about slippage and oracle manipulation. Reentrancy bugs show us the importance of checks-effects-interactions.\nSmart contract exploits evolve the entire ecosystem forward.\nPrivate key leaks just leave us guessing whether someone clicked the wrong link or decided to get rich quick.\nAnd if the people holding the keys can’t be trusted, who really owns anything on-chain?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

    "text": "Hypervault-Rug-Liquidity Extraction\nNinety-five percent APY buys a lot of hopium - and even more exit liquidity.\nHyperVault promised automated yield optimization across Hyperliquid's HyperEVM, delivering eye-watering returns through \"modular strategy adapters\" and \"keeper-bot harvests.\"\nBehind the buzzwords sat an internal ledger system with no share tokens, privileged admin functions disguised as safety features, and a team claiming audits from firms who'd never heard their name.\nSeptember 26th brought the inevitable: $4.64 million vanished through deBridge to Ethereum,then straight into Tornado Cashwhile depositors watched their vaults drain to zero.\nSocial accounts deleted, Discord nuked, founders ghosted - textbook exit choreography executed with the precision of a team who'd clearly practiced on previous projects.\nWhen your yield aggregator aggregates user funds into a single wallet before disappearing, who's really getting optimized?\nNinety-five percent APYon a new DeFi protocolsounds ambitious.\nSeventy-six percent on stablecoinssounds delusional.\nBoth together? That's the sound of a rug being rolled out.\nHyperVault marketed itself as Hyperliquid's as a non-custodial, auto-compounding yield aggregator on HyperEVM.\nBehind the glossy docs sat something uglier: an internal accounting system with no ERC-4626 shares, privileged contract functions hidden behind modifiers, andaudit claims from firms who'd never heard of them.\nSeptember 4thbrought the first warning.\nBy September 25th,the inevitable arrived.\nBetween those dates,1,100 depositors ignored every red flag waving in their faces- fake audit claims, anonymous team members, yields that defied market gravity.\nNick Olsen from Sweden played founderwhile anetwork of developers with curious GitHub histories built the infrastructure.\nThey'd done this before under different names: ZinoFinance, Zero-G Finance, PerfectSwap.\nSame playbook, different wrapper.\nTwo main exploitation addresses drained fundsfrom 9 vaults into aconsolidation wallet.\nFunds bridged to Ethereum through deBridge. Swapped to ETH. Thendisappeared into Tornado Cashwhilesocial accounts vanishedand websites went dark.\nBy the time security firms flagged the movement, the operation was complete.\nRecovery odds for the victims? Zero.\nOdds the same team runs this script again under a new name?\nTrouble wasspotted on September 4th, 2025.\nHypingBull, a Hyperliquid community member,posted a warning that should have emptied every vault: \"MAX REPOST: HYPERVAULT PROJECT IS DOING SHADY STUFF.\"\nThe protocol claimed audits were\"pending via Spearbit, Pashov, and Code4rena\" with an expected turnaround mid-September.\nStandard legitimacy theater - drop some respected names, promise transparency, buy time while deposits pile up.\nHypingBull went straight to Pashov on Telegram to confirmif HyperVault was really being audited. The reply was blunt: ‘First time I hear the project with this name.’”\nCode4rena's websiteshowedno pending audits for HyperVault. Nothing in the queue, nothing in progress, nothing planned. Complete fabrication.\nTVL at the time: $700,000.\nHypingBullwithdrew everything and told others to do the same.\nMost didn't listen.\nSince that callout,HyperVault's claimed TVL had grown to $5.8 million-likely inflated, but real money nonetheless.\nDefiLlama showed $4.97 millionon September 24th, then zero the next day.\nSeptember 23rd brought another voice into the mix.\nHYPEconomist, a prominent Hyperliquid community influencer,tweeted about HyperVault with an endorsement: \"cooking! use the money and put it into a hypervault.\"\nThree days before the rug.\nAfter the collapse, community members were less forgiving.\nOne post summed it up: \"HYPEconomist is a shill for Hypervault that just rugged its users. Beware of scammers like this in the HL community.\"\nHYPEconomist's response: \"they rugged me too.\"\nWhether victim or enabler, the endorsement three days before the exit didn't age well.\nBut even HYPEconomist's endorsement wasn't the most damning part of this story.\nSomeone actually did audit HyperVault.\nHow does a legitimate security audit end up as camouflage for a rug pull?\nSeptember 14th- HyperVault announced on X they were starting an audit with Zenith.\nNote the language: starting. Not completing, not publishing, not implementing fixes. Starting.\nZenith actually showed upand did the work.\nTheir draft audit, delivered privately on September 24th, found 42 total vulnerabilities. Six rated High severity. Ten rated Medium.\nThis is the kind of stuff that would make any team hit panic mode - if they actually cared.\nZenith's recommendation was unambiguous:full re-audit required after fixes.\nHyperVault's response? Acknowledgment in private. Silence in public. Then two days later, they executed the rug.\nThedraft audit never saw daylight.\nNo public disclosure, no transparency about the severity of issues found, no indication that depositors were trusting their funds to a protocol riddled with critical vulnerabilities.\nZenith had done their job. Found the problems. Warned the team. Recommended remediation.\nNone of it mattered because the team had no intention of fixing anything.\nThey weren't building a sustainable protocol. They were running out the clock.\nPost-collapse,Zenith confirmed they'd be cooperating fully with investigators.\nDocuSign metadata from the audit engagement contained an IP address- one belonging to Nicholas Olsen, the supposed founder who'd later vanish along with the funds.\nMeanwhile, Hybra Finance found themselvescaught in the blast radius.\nThey'd integrated with HyperVault,even quote-retweeted an announcement after seeing Zenith's name attached.\nThat retweetwas based on Zenith announcing the audit was starting- not that it had passed, not that issues were resolved, just that an audit process had begun.\nAfter the rug,Hybra issued a mea culpa: \"We clearly did not do enough DD.\"\nTheyoffered full reimbursement to users who'd interacted with HyperVault after September 25, 3PM UTC- the timestamp when Hybra amplified their post - and who had prior on-chain interaction with Hybra.\nA small goodwill allocation would go to all HyperVault victims at Hybra's launch.\nDamage control from a project that learned an expensive lesson about vetting their integrations.\nBut even with warnings from community members, a draft audit showing critical flaws, and yields that defied basic mathematics, deposits kept flowing in.\nWhat does it take for pattern recognition to override greed?\nHyperVault's architecture wasn't sophisticated - it was deliberately opaque.\nMany DeFi protocols useERC-4626 vault standards. Share tokens represent your deposit. You can see them in your wallet, track them on explorers, verify your ownership on-chain.\nTransparent, auditable, simple.\nHyperVaultchose a different path.\nInternal ledger system. Global accrual index.No share tokens cluttering up your walletor leaving traces on block explorers.\nEverything tracked inside the contract's internal state.\nOn paper, it is \"gas-efficient\" and \"math neat.\"\nReality?Perfect camouflage for a rug.\nWithout share tokens,casual observers couldn't easily audit who owned what.\nThe protocol kept all state internally, behind contract code. Shifts in vault balances happened invisibly until someone bothered to query the contract directly.\nHidden among the standard functions sat the real payload:privileged admin access wrapped in an onlyHV() modifier.\nIt looked like a safety feature, but acted like a master key.\nSeptember 25th, they pulled the trigger.\nThe owner set the staking contract to their own EOA. Then initiated mass withdrawals from all 9 vaults.\nFour days before the rug, the HyperVault developer funded five addresses from Hypercore to HyperEVM via spotSend to cover gas fees in $HYPE.\nOf those five addresses, only two were used for the extraction:\nPrimary exploitation address:0x79957ce3c826030d642b9ba6f60b896b61588af8\nSecondary exploitation address:0x8d851eb3995ef0e2e7a3581316b4899b414c9bcf\nFunder wallet:0x49c083a19a25734b0c66bcc0d16333a36c3a7bf0\nFrom there, the laundering operation moved with practiced efficiency.\nSwapped various tokens into HYPE.\nBridged to Ethereum via deBridge in batch after batch.\nPrimary address bridging (906.88 ETH - $3.73M):0x79957ce3c826030d642b9ba6f60b896b61588af8\nSecondary address bridging: (219.85 ETH - $905K):0x8d851eb3995ef0e2e7a3581316b4899b414c9bcf\nTotal bridged to Ethereum:1,126.72 ETH ($4.64 million)\nThe funds split across four landing wallets on Ethereum:\n147.93 ETH:0x56e90397133aea9b9a087c3c93467875ed4a2be7\n127.35 ETH:0xd74ea73957a4eac6a9636221421a3a69b4714eee\n631.59 ETH:0xee882b9ada0895376fd90a2b6a80d6d7f7f06396\n219.85 ETH:0x7901922af07526a66b63c479565f44e81889f4e2\nOver the next 3-4 days, most of the 1,126 ETH disappeared into Tornado Cash across multiple deposit transactions from these four wallets. Only gas fee dust remains in the landing addresses.\nSpecterAnalyst's forensic analysisrevealed the exploitation addresses.\nFollowing those breadcrumbs through the deBridge transactions confirmed the full scope: $4.64 million with complete on-chain proof.\nPretty close to the$4.97 million TVL reported on DefiLlamabefore the rug.\nSpecterAnalyst traced the Tornado Cash withdrawalsto their new destinations:\nLabeled as Multisig:0x4A47D00F97deDf7D8890ECb248823f3DA842B0D8\nOther Wallets Involved:0x25A8C73c0541A3876bc2236a0b20C179872f44100x8E24c9d098e63fcDBdbC1fF9cAF7b684aA98285B0x8ceF0B6b63ca3Dd56393Ad1bBACD8F05384F47D00x0aDa87Cb5df3B579812bf5FcE36a2603b193ab300x92747063F7E1CA985D99cBD4418Cc23f3b8d4c7B0x1235058627620b5e3eDAe9A2241A457169c8DFe5\nBy the time anyone realized what was happening, the operation was already complete.\nSocial accounts deleted. Discord server gone. Website offline. Documentation vanished.\nRecovery through legal channels? Tornado Cash makes that a fantasy.\nRecovery through negotiation? Can't negotiate with ghosts.\nFor a team that supposedly spent months building \"modular strategy adapters,\" they sure executed the exit with surgical precision.\nMakes you wonder - what were they really building all along?\nSay hello toNick Olsen from Sweden.\nThat's the face HyperVault put forward. His Twitter handle0xNyck, somehow still exists despite the FUD.\nDiscord username\"0xnyck | hypervault.fi\" - joined the server only in September 2025despite claiming months of development since late July.\nEmail used for business development:rizwan.bizdev@gmail.com.\nMultiple community members, including HYPEconomist,confirmed having video calls with Olsen before depositing funds.\nDoxxed calls, face on camera, the whole trust-building routine.\nThen he vanished with $4.64 million.\nBehind Olsen sat a network of developerswhose GitHub activity told a more interesting story.\nBrutalTrade revealed their identities- or at least the email addresses they were careless enough to leave exposed:\njamestarlancer -carlhamilton0503@gmail.comgurujustin -kkh0102www@outlook.comres-pan -butcherfinance@gmail.comhypervim -jansuu62@gmail.comperfect-swap -ropstvanka@gmail.compandorabok -borkovicbiljana9@gmail.comnickbit0 -nick@bitnue.comchaincoderpro -chaincoderpro@gmail.com\nWhen confronted on Telegram after the collapse, their response was telling -they started deleting repositories and accountsinstead of explaining anything.\nJamestarlancer nuked his entire GitHubwithin minutes of being called out.Gurujustin removed the zerog-ui repository, then deleted his account entirely.\nGuilty people don't typically scramble to destroy evidence unless they know what's coming.\nBut HyperVault wasn't their first rodeo.\nBrutalTrade connected the dots across multiple projects: Zero-G Finance, PerfectSwap, and NodeSynapse.\nAll registered through Njalla- an anonymous domain registrar popular with people who have something to hide.\nDomain registration pattern:\nhypervault.finance\nzino.finance\nzerog.finance\nperfectswap.io\nseadrome.finance\nSame registrar. Maybe the same team, in the end, the same outcome.*\nSmart move - if any of these developers used their project emails for GitHub, Twitter, Discord, or other platforms, those password reset links could lead somewhere interesting.\nBrutalTrade didn't just trace funds - he traced patterns.\nHe found wallet connections spanning multiple projects. Andalso discovered a Binance deposit address that had received fundsfrom addresses controlled by the scammers.\nBinance Deposit Address on Arkham:0xb51d4e01f8fd81db35fca780c32369ba94ba72b5\nSeptember 28th,BrutalTrade sent an ultimatum directly to addresses associated with the team: return the funds, keep 10% as a bounty, and all legal action stops. Twenty-four hours to respond.\nThey didn't.\nThe message went to five specific addresses tied to the operation, and toone of the wallets they'd used while developing ZinoFinance- just to make sure they knew this wasn't a bluff.\nBrutalTrade's parting message: \"We git cloned everything ;)\"\nEvery repository, every commit, every piece of code these developers touched - archived before they could delete it.\nDigital breadcrumbs that might not recover the funds, but could help identify the people behind the keyboards.\nThehunt continues- BrutalTrade opened aTelegram channelfor the community to coordinate ongoing tracking efforts.\nSerial scammers leave patterns. This team left highways.\nHow many more project names are they workshopping right now?\nBrutalTrade's investigation didn't just trace the scammers- it caught innocent bystanders in the net.\nKupia Security, a legitimate audit firm, found themselves flagged when blockchain analysis revealed their wallet (kupia.eth)had sent $25 to the same Binance deposit address used by the HyperVault scammers.\nBrutalTradeposted the connection publicly.\nBut BrutalTrade wasn’t done and found more connectionsthrough helloalan.eth - an address that had sent $1,800 and $2,500 to Kupia, then separately sent $120 to that same scammer Binance address.\nAnother wallet linked to Kupia's operations (auditsea9 on GitHub) appeared in the transaction web.\nKupia responded fast: That $25 transaction happened March 22, 2024 - 553 days before the rug. They'd tried buying an ENS domain or VPS from what turned out to be a sketchy vendor.\nThey sent the money, butnever received the service.\nJust another cautionary tale about crypto transactions.\nBlockchain analysis connects wallets, but not the intent.\nA vendor running a scam operation can take payments from dozens of legitimate businesses.\nThose businesses aren't accomplices - they're victims too.\nBrutalTrade clarified: \"The goal is precisely to connect the dots, not to say that you are implicated, far from it, but to say that at some point you had a relationship with that person.\"\nFair enough. Every thread needs pulling when you're hunting ghosts.\nKupia threatened legal actionif the accusations continued.\nBrutalTrade backed off the direct implicationsbut kept the wallet connections documented.\nEither way, it illustrated the messy reality of on-chain detective work.\nSometimes innocent parties get caught in the crossfire when investigators follow every lead.\nWhen the blockchain shows connections but can't prove intent, how do you separate accomplices from collateral damage?\nNinety-five percent APY never meant high returns - it meant high-speed extraction.\nHyperVault spent weeks building legitimacy: fake audit claims, video calls with depositors, integration partnerships, social media presence.\nIt was all theater.\nThe internal ledger system, the privileged admin functions, the anonymous dev team with serial scammer histories - the infrastructure was always designed for one purpose.\nSeptember 26th just marked execution day.\nNick Olsen and his network of GitHub ghosts are gone, $4.64 million lighter in other people's pockets, already workshopping their next project name while 1,100 victims learn an expensive lesson about pattern recognition.\nMaybe somewhere in Sweden or behind a VPN, the architects are counting their ETH.\nWhen the same team runs the same scam under different names and it keeps working, who's really getting rugged - the depositors or the entire concept of due diligence?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The protocol has remained radio silent since the incident.\nWhen your protocol works flawlessly for hackers but catastrophically fails users, what exactly were you building?\nBlockaid's exploit detection system caught the carnage first- “multiple malicious transactions targeting NGP on BSC”, with roughly $2 million drained.\nReal-time monitoring turned into a live autopsy as security firms rushed to explain how spectacularly NGP had failed.\nPeckShield confirmed the obvious hours later: \"$NGP token fromnewgoldprotocolwas exploited for ~$2M.\"\nToken down 88% in an hour, stolen funds already washing through Tornado Cash.\nMeanwhile,New Gold Protocol's Twitter account? Complete radio silence.\nNo acknowledgment, no damage control, no \"we're investigating\" platitudes.\nJust the digital equivalent of hiding under a rock while security firms dissected their corpse in public.\nEven 24 hours later, NGP couldn't muster a single tweet about losing $2 million of other people's money.\nThey were still promoting their launch, like they were living in an alternate reality.\nIronically, on September 14th,they posted that: \"Security is non-negotiable.\"\nApparently neither is staying silent when your non-negotiable security gets negotiated away for $2 million?\nNGP's code was a fine example in writing the worst possible smart contract.\nTwo catastrophic flaws that any competent developer would catch in five minutes of testing, but somehow made it to mainnet.\nTwo fatal flaws working in perfect harmony: a getPrice() function that trusted PancakeSwap reserves like gospel, and transfer logic so broken it made the exploit trivial.\nPrice oracles 101: never rely on a single DEX pool's reserves for pricing.\nAttackers can manipulate those numbers with flash loans faster than you can say \"rug pull.\"\nNGP apparently skipped that lecture.\nThe attack script was embarrassingly simple.\nFlashloan $211 million, dump it intothe mainPair pool to crash NGP reservesand inflate the USDT side.\nNow getPrice() thinks NGP is worthless, letting the attacker bypass maxBuyAmountInUsdt limits by buying massive amounts of tokens.\nBut here's where NGP's incompetence really shines: their transfer function included a \"fee mechanism\"that deducted 35% from the pool balancewhenever someone sold, then called sync() to update reserves.\nThis wasn't a feature - it was a self-destruct button waiting to be pressed.\nTheattacker bought NGP tokens earlier with multiple accounts, then used the manipulated pricing to acquire even more tokens bysetting the recipient address to the \"dead\" address - conveniently whitelistedto bypass buying restrictions.\nFinally, they dumped all their NGP tokens, triggering that transfer logic mechanismthat reduced the pool's NGP reserves from 477,000 to 0.035 tokens.\nWhen you reduce token reserves by 13.6 million times, you don't just break the AMM's x*y=k invariant - you obliterate it.\nPool drained, attack complete, protocol dead.\nWhat happens when your smart contract's biggest security feature is teaching attackers exactly how to rob you?\nTornado Cash funded the wallet that killed NGP. Classic move - mix your ETH, bridge to BNB Chain, then go shopping for vulnerable protocols.\nTornado Cash Funding (September 10th):0x31b80cf3b477948fb47a03aa5ecb8a9e30b99840e59af8959e5797c1ea4cd3a3\nExploiter Address:0x0305ddd42887676ec593b39ace691b772eb3c876\nAttack Transaction:0xc2066e0dff1a8a042057387d7356ad7ced76ab90904baa1e0b5ecbc2434df8e1\nSeptember 17th, 7:02 PM UTC - NGP went from \"promising new protocol\" to \"expensive lesson\" in a single transaction.\nFlash loan secured, reserves manipulated, limits bypassed, pool drained. All the stolen USDT got swapped to ETH and bridged back to Ethereum mainnet.\nEthereum Address:0x8618314270528e245fbbb6fba54e245bb61a8d47\n444 ETH was methodically fed into Tornado Cash's tumble cycle.\nThe attacker didn't rush - they broke down the haul into digestible chunks over 10 minutes.\nAlmost twenty separate deposits into Tornado Cash's mixer pools: 0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, 10 ETH, and 100 ETH increments.\nStandard Tornado Cash denominations, but the systematic approach suggests someone familiar with the mixing process.\nThey didn't reinvent the wheel, just found a protocol dumb enough to let them use it.\nWhen your exploit gets traced by every major security firm but your protocol can't even acknowledge it happened, who really got played?\nNGP's five-year roadmap promised\"AI-powered contract auditing improves security\" by 2026.\nApparently they planned to wait three years before bothering with basic security measures.\nTheir whitepaperreads like fever dream economics mixed with ChatGPT hallucinations:\n\"Native DEX with automated matching,\" \"Layer 2 testnets,\" \"Aurora AI v2 enables automated fund management\" - all scheduled for 2026 while their 2025 launch couldn't handle basic price feeds.\nEven theirresources page screams amateur hour. Documentation hosted on Google Drive?\nProfessional protocols use proper hosting, version control, and redundancy. NGP used free cloud storage like a college student sharing homework.\nThe protocol that promised to build an \"intelligent civilization\" couldn't figure out how to prevent flash loan attacks that script kiddies master in weekend hackathons.\nTheir roadmap talks about AI-powered auditingwhile their current code suggests they've never heard of human-powered auditing.\nThree days of security promises, hours of actual uptime, and years of grandiose plans that will never see mainnet.\nNGP managed to speedrun the entire lifecycle of a failed protocol - hype, launch, exploit, silence, irrelevance.\nWhen your protocol's biggest achievement is teaching others what not to do, was building it ever the point?\nRadio silence isn't just NGP's Twitter strategy - it's their entire community management playbook.\nOver 24 hours since losing $2 million andtheir Telegram channelreads like nothing happened.\nNo team announcements, no damage control, no panicked community members demanding answers.\nThe chat logs show regular activity but zero mention of the $2 million hack.\nNGP created the perfect echo chamber - a community so detached from reality that a $2 million exploit doesn't even register as newsworthy.\nMaybe staying quiet worked for their 299 Twitter followers, but ignoring catastrophic security failures doesn't make them disappear.\nWhile security firms dissected their code and traced their stolen funds across multiple blockchains, NGP's team apparently decided the best crisis management strategy was pretending the crisis never existed.\nTheir roadmap promised an intelligent civilization by 2030, but they couldn't even manage intelligent damage control for 48 hours.\nIf your protocol gets rekt in DeFi but nobody in your community talks about it, did the exploit really happen?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Combined with strip-ansi, color-convert, and fourteen other compromised utilities, the attack's reach exceeded most nation-states' digital influence.\nBut reach means nothing without targeting, and here's where the attackers revealed their fundamental misunderstanding of software distribution.\nThey'd built abrowser-based crypto-clipper designed to hijack crypto wallet transactions, swap Ethereum addresses using visual similarity algorithms, and drain wallets through invisible manipulation.\nSophisticated malware that monkey-patched fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and window.ethereum with surgical precision.\nOne problem: npm packages run on servers and build systems, not browsers where crypto wallets live.\nHow do you steal from crypto users when your malware never reaches crypto users?\nThe attackersembedded a crypto stealer in the compromised packages.\nFunctions with names like checkethereumwburied beneath layers of variable name manglingand control flow flattening.\nThis stealer was not designed for desktop environmentsand does not attempt to read any files or install any malware.\nRather, it checks if window.ethereum exists,and if so installs hooks on the request, send, and sendAsync functions.\nIt also overwritesthe fetch and XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open and XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send functions.\nIf window.ethereum is hooked,it intercepts both Ethereum and Solana requests.\nFor Ethereum requests, itoverwrites the destination address of any call to approve, permit, transfer, and transferFromto a hardcoded attacker address.\nFor Solana requests,it overwrites the recipient, destination, and keys on each account to 19111111111111111111111111111111.\nFor network requests made over fetch or XMLHttpRequest, it modifies responses (especially JSON) to replace substrings that resemble cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled ones fromapproximately 280 hardcoded addresses.\nIt uses the Levenshtein distance to calculate the address that has the closest edit distance to the original address- making your transaction to 1BijzJvYU2GaBCYHa8Hf3PnJh6mjEd92UP become a payment to 1BBAQm4DL78JtRdJGEfzDBT2PBkGyvzf4N with nearly identical visual appearance.\nIn environments where window.ethereum exists, this digital pickpocket would have been devastating.\nBut here's the fatal flaw:the malware didn't even check if fetch was defined, which raised errors in CI/CD environmentswhere npm packages actually run.\nThe sophisticated crypto-stealer immediately announced its presence by breaking basic Node.js compatibility.\nThe attackers built a Ferrari to rob a bank, then tried to drive it through a server farm.\nWhen perfect technical execution meets perfect strategic miscalculation, which failure hurts more?\nJosh Junon's transparency became crypto Twitter's favorite redemption arc within hours.\n\"Hi, yep I got pwned. Sorry everyone, very embarrassing,\"he posted on HackerNews - the kind of brutal honesty that usually gets you canceled but somehow made him the internet's favorite victim.\nNo corporate damage control, no lawyers drafting careful statements, just a guy admitting he clicked the wrong link during a stressful week.\nBut while Josh was owning his mistake, the attackers' malware was busy exposing itself.\nThe malware didn't check if fetch was defined, which raised errors in CI/CD environments- a fatal flaw that immediately announced the attack's presence.\nThe sophisticated crypto-clipper had become its own whistleblower.\nFive minutes after Josh's account compromise,Aikido's threat detection caught the anomaly.\nOne hour later, Charlie was broadcasting warnings across security channelswhile the attackers had no clue their own malware was snitching on them.\nThe phishing email hadn't just hijacked Josh's account - it turned his reputation into roadkill for a heist targeting users who'd never even see the malicious code.\nBy 15:15 UTC, Josh was panic-deleting compromised packageswhile simultaneously getting locked out of his own account.\nThe attackers had changed his credentials faster than npm's security team could blink, leaving the guy who built these packages unable to clean up his own mess.\nSimple-swizzle remained poisoned long after other packages got sanitized, a digital crime scene that nobody could touch.\nGrep commands for finding infected packages went viral faster than TikTok dances.\nThedeveloper community's immune responsekicked in with terrifying efficiency - thousands of developers auditing millions of installations within hours.\nBut missing from every security advisory, every Twitter thread, every emergency Slack channel discussion was the most important detail:nobody could find any actual victims.\nWhen your master heist generates more security awareness than stolen cryptocurrency, did you accidentally become a public service announcement?\nPicture this:you compromise an npm developer whose packagesdownload over 2 billion times per week.\nUnfettered access to millions of developer workstations. Untold digital riches await. The world is your oyster.\nThe final haul, according toRani Haddad’s tracking, theattackers' walletappears to contain approximately $1,050 - though this remains unverified as the entity is labeled as \"custom\" on Arkham Intelligence.\nTayvano cloned the wallet, confirmingno TRON activity and reinforcing its attribution to the attackers.\nThe attackers executed a supply chain chaos, then walked away with just over a thousand dollars in crypto - hardly the haul of the century.\nWhilesecurity teams burned collective thousands of hours analyzing the malware, coordinating responses, and patching compromised environments, the criminals netted less than some people’s rent.\nLedger's CTO Charles Guillemet summed up the absurdity perfectly: \"The attack fortunately failed, with almost no victims.\"\nThe malicious packages were live on npmfor barely two hours.\nIn that window, any developer or build system updating dependencies could have pulled in the compromised code.\nThe fallout was… spectacular.\nOpen source maintainersflipped on emergency 2FA.\nThe infectionrippled through millions of projects. Security teams everywhere scrambled to see if their builds had pulled in the malicious code.\nThe real damage wasn’t the stolen crypto - it was the security theater that followed.\nSEAL mentioned the millions of dollars of sales contractsthat will inevitably be signed as a result of this new case study.\nOrganizations spending millions in reaction to a theft worth barely a month’s rent.\nThe heist failed, but the panic? Priceless.\nWho profits more from supply chain attacks - the attackers or the security industry that responds to them?\nProfessional attackers examine every link in the development-to-delivery chain, exploiting each step with methodical precision.\nThese could have been weekend warriors with good tutorials - they understood supply chain methodology enough to be dangerous, had time for sustained preparation, and copy-pasted sophisticated malware techniques without understanding where their targets actually lived.\nThey just forgot where crypto wallets actually live.\nQueen of “you should have known better” zingers,Tayvano highlighted the solution that could have preventedthis mess:\"Lavamoat. It was literally built for supply chain attacks. It would've prevented the malicious code from monkey patching globals (xmlhttprequest, fetch, window.ethereum) at runtime. It's free.\"\nFor developers drowning in dependency hell,package overrides became the new religion.\nForce specific versions in package.json, delete node_modules like you're exorcising demons, regenerate lockfiles with the fervor of someone who learned their lesson the expensive way.\nPin everything, trust nothing, assume your favorite utility package got compromised last Tuesday.\nHardware wallet evangelists seized their moment harder than crypto influencers pump dog coins.\n\"One code execution away from losing everything,\"Guillemet warned, and suddenly those clunky signing devices seemed less annoying than software wallets running on compromised systems.\nClear signing features that force users to verify transaction details manually- tedious until your MetaMask starts routing payments to Pyongyang.\nBut the real lesson cuts deeper than tooling recommendations.\nJosh Junon's brutal honesty- \"Hi, yep I got pwned. Sorry everyone, very embarrassing\" - saved the ecosystem more damage than any security vendor's incident response playbook.\nTransparency accelerated discovery, coordinated fixes, and prevented copycats from succeeding with similar attacks.\nWhen admitting failure becomes your most valuable security control, what does that say about an industry built on trustless systems?\nCrypto Twitter screamed about the Cryptopocalypse over $1050.\nSEAL Alliance captured the absurdity perfectly: compromise an npm developer whose packages download over 2 billion times weekly, gain potential access to millions of developer workstations, hold untold digital riches in your grasp - then profit less than what most people spend on a phone.\nThe Great NPM Heist proved that execution without strategy is just expensive performance art.\nAttackers built the perfect crypto-stealing machine and deployed it where crypto doesn't exist, potentially netting around $1,000 that wouldn't cover a single Ethereum transaction during peak congestion.\nMeanwhile, the industry's panic response generated more financial damage than the actual theft - emergency audits, vendor contracts, and compliance theater that could cost millions while the criminals walked away with lunch money.\nPeople treated this like the end times over pocket change that most developers lose buying energy drinks during all-nighters.\nHistory's largest supply chain attack netted less than a decent laptop while generating the security industry's most profitable overreaction.\nWhen your master heist accidentally becomes a public service announcement about dependency hygiene, who's really getting rekt - the ecosystem that survived or the attackers who forgot where crypto wallets live?\nIf a thousand dollars can trigger an industry-wide security meltdown, what happens when someone actually knows what they're targeting?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

    "text": "GriffinAI-Admin Privileges-Rekt\nLess than 24 hours after launching on Binance Alpha, Griffin AI watched their carefully planned tokenomics explode into hyperinflationary chaos.\nSomeone with the right connections convinced LayerZero that a fake Ethereum contract deserved the same trust as the real one, then proceeded to mint 5 billion unauthorized $GAIN tokens like a rogue central banker.\nThe attackerdumped just 2.8% of their freshly printed fortune for a clean $3 million payday, leaving the remaining 97.2% as a digital sword of Damocles hanging over what remained of $GAIN's market cap.\nGriffin AI's founder stepped up with a mea culpa that's rare in DeFi- full responsibility, no excuses, complete ownership of the security failure that happened \"on his watch.\"\nBut taking blame doesn't resurrect dead tokenomics or explain how someone gained the power to rewrite cross-chain infrastructure rules without anyone noticing.\nWhen your bridge becomes someone else's money printer, who's really controlling the flow of value across chains?\nGoPlus Security spotted the bleeding firston September 24th:\n\"The Web3 AI project Griffin AI, which just launched on Binance Alpha, has been hit by malicious minting that issued an additional 5 billion tokens for dumping (with $GAIN's maximum supply being 1 billion tokens), causing the $GAIN price to plummet over 90%.\"\nGoPlus followed up with posting a screenshot of the malicious mintingthat pushed GAIN's supply 5x beyond its intended 1 billion token cap.\nTheir warning was crystal clear: users should avoid interacting with the project to prevent losses while the attack was still unfolding.\nCertiK watched it happen live: \"The attacker initialized a false LayerZero Peer on Ethereum, then bridged 5B fake tokens to mint 5B $GAIN on BSC.\"\nPeckShield followed the money- 147.5M $GAIN dumped for 2,955 BNB, bridged to Ethereum, swapped for 720 ETH, with 700 ETH hitting Tornado Cash.\nBlockscope mapped the laundering operation across chainswhile the funds were still warm.\nSecurity firms moved faster than Griffin AI's own damage control team - by the time the project acknowledged the exploit, blockchain forensics had already mapped the entire money trail.\nWhat does it say about protocol security when external watchdogs sound the alarm before the protocol even knows it's bleeding?\nGriffin AI's first public admission came 22 minutes after GoPlus sounded the alarm - a masterclass in corporate understatement.\n\"We are investigating the issue and will make a detailed post as soon as we have more information,\"they posted shortly after the exploit, treating a $3 million heist like a minor technical glitch.\nNo acknowledgment of the scale, no warning to users, just bureaucratic placeholder text while their token bled out in real-time.\nFounder Oliver Feldmeierfinally stepped up over an hour later with the technical breakdown: an unauthorized LayerZero peer setup had enabled the attacker to deploy a fake Ethereum contract ($TTTTT at 0x7a8caf) and use it to mint 5 billion GAIN on BNB Chain.\nThe mea culpa came the following day -a rare display of executive accountability in DeFi.\n\"This is an incredibly difficult day, and I want to start by offering my deepest, most sincere apologies to the entire Griffin AI community,\"Feldmeier wrote, taking full responsibility for the security incident that happened\"on my watch.\"\nHe promised a complete migration to a new, fully audited tokenwith restored balances based on pre-hack snapshots - essentially admitting their original tokenomics were beyond repair.\nThe real question isn't how LayerZero got fooled - it's how someone got the keys to fool it. Admin privileges don't just leak into the wrong hands by accident. Someone either got phished, got paid, or got careless.\nBut ownership of failure doesn't explain how someone gained the power to rewrite cross-chain infrastructure rules without anyone noticing until the damage was done.\nWhy does taking responsibility feel more like damage control when the fundamental questions remain unanswered?\nLayerZero's peer system turned into Griffin AI's personal money printer.\nSomeone with admin access ran the classic DeFi con - make the bridge believe fake tokens are real tokens.\nContract0x7a8cafbecame the decoy while the real GAIN endpoint sat ignored at0xccdbb9.\nFake Contract (Decoy):0x7a8CAffeb11047E90Affc9F7527103b0334572E6\nReal GAIN Endpoint Contract:0xccdbb9c8e43f50407c58f81407a16549e2a475dd\nDeploy fake $TTTTT token on Ethereum. Swap it in as the LayerZero peer. Watch the bridge treat phantom deposits like legitimate cross-chain transfers.\nBut here's how they actually pulled it off:Blocksec Phalcon revealedthe attacker managed to get an Admin address to invoke the setPeer function - maybe via phishing.\nThis action designated a malicious contract address as a trusted peer, enabling arbitrary token minting through the cross-chain bridge.\nCompromised Admin Address (On BSC):0x54A978238984d581EdD3a9359dDA9BE53A930a7e\nMalicious Contract Peer Address (On Ethereum):0xba159054636e69080ae7c756319e5c85498efeb0\nThe setPeer transaction on BSC shows exactly when the attackergained their minting privileges.\nNo collateral backing required. No verification. Just minting privileges for days.\nGriffin AI's own infrastructure couldn't tell the difference between real cross-chain messages and complete fiction,happily minting 5 billion GAIN tokenswhile the attacker counted their phantom Ethereum \"deposits.\"\n5 billion GAIN tokens minted:0xa85b18bdbd32fbe5468de38032f7f2717faaad663d33991b2c71ce0b3892e866\nThis wasn't an isolated incident,as highlighted by Blocksec Phalcon: \"Yet another attack targeting Griffin AI similar to the Seedifyfund incident: fraudulent cross-chain messages from the source chain were accepted and executed on the destination chain.\"\nGoPlus Security specifically flagged the exploit as similar to\"a prior attack on the Yala project,\" where fake LayerZero peers were also used to bypass cross-chain security checks.\nLayerZero's peer trust system keeps getting owned the same way - Seedify, Yala, now Griffin AI, all falling for the same fake peer con.\nWhat the blockchain recorded was elegant in its simplicity: someone convinced a bridge that the fake was real, then cashed out before anyone noticed the difference.\nWhen cross-chain infrastructure can't distinguish between authentic and counterfeit peers, what's stopping the next attacker from running the same playbook?\nThe blockchain doesn't lie about the execution.\nTheattacker minted 5 billion GAIN tokens, bloating total supply from 1 billion to 5.2985 billion.\nAttacker address:0xf3d17326130f90c1900bc0b69323c4c7e2d58db2\nHere's what makes it beautiful: they dumped just 147.5 million tokens.\nThat's2.8% of their money printer output, but enough toobliterate GAIN's price by 90%andwalk away with 2,955 BNB (~$3 million).\nThe other 4.85 billion tokens? Still sitting in the attacker’s wallet.\nAttacker’s Wallet on Arkham (still unlabeled):0xF3d17326130F90c1900bc0B69323C4C7E2d58Db2\nPancakeSwap's shallow liquidityturned a modest dump into total devastation.\nThestolen BNB got bridged to Ethereum via deBridgewhile Griffin AI was still figuring out what hit them.\ndeBridge Transaction 1:0xcfaf94a7d7e4b56bf0698f2cba88e46c2cc1c584a897e65f1a63ac88de290045\ndeBridge Transaction 2:0x31661ffc5311cd13bf59cb3a5122198c2ce4d4420d221bedfba634fdda49fc58\ndeBridge Transaction 3:0x22afbc0ecb066e7247a68919082d9bc1b3f59cb02582ee113f2d570cb446ea57\ndeBridge Transaction 4:0x9be63ee5b0175328403ea0b9ecd55b676e528ee43beba065e83b0d25bc1fae2c\ndeBridge Transaction 5:0x3a175487668f521e4aedf86aa2d96f059b50f08520c31c164fb16265fe2f8e0b\ndeBridge Transaction 6:0x16fbdad32ad3f875918604a8f27edd1a22e0e23c6845a6d5b4e0a41741f2d5f2\nSome funds made it to Tornado Cashfor laundering.\nAccording to EmberCN, the 2,955 BNB were converted through deBridge into roughly 720 ETH and distributed into the following six wallets.\n5 of the wallets laundered 100 ETH each and the other laundered 200 ETH.\nWallets used for laundering:\n0x1afc80d0E15cBCBfAAB9aD5520b4ab843Dfd648D0xD4d83C2BC58B97d6458a7AE7d5b417c5422DC04C0xB31BDDb3d1c2b45E5c5fE149Aa4c8304e9D1916C0xa6654f227EcCF2f84476d2d51434081613F8Baba0x107E83EBE677DDec253C440127F23310720177c2\nThis wallet moved 200 ETH and is still sitting on 20 ETH:0xf1755A2b7d0e418E9BAB4F81AD674fa39fA7F23D\nThe attacker didn't need to cash out everything to destroy everything.\nHow do you spin a story where 2.8% of fake tokens obliterated 90% of your market cap?\nThe dance floor emptied fast once Griffin AI realized the DJ had left the building.\nWithin an hour of detecting the exploit, they pulled the emergency brake on everything that mattered - official liquidity pools vanished from BNB Chain like ghosts at sunrise.\n\"Please DO NOT interact with any LPs that may be created by the attacker.\nThey are not official and pose a risk,\"Griffin AI warned, essentially admitting they'd lost control of their own token ecosystem.\nDaily trading volume surged 126% to $96 millionas panic selling dominated DEXs.\nGriffin AI painted the shutdown in corporate poetry: \"we’re coordinating closely with exchanges and security partners\" while users watched their portfolios bleed in real-time.\nGriffin AI called out to all exchanges to pauseGAIN trading,with KuCoinandMEXC respondingso far by suspending deposits, withdrawals, and trading.\nGriffin AI also announced the end of its airdrop campaignsfollowing the exploit, though the completed Binance Alpha airdrop remained unaffected, leaving users staring at frozen expansion plans while the token burned around them.\nThe music had stopped, but the dancers were still falling - and some were still trying to trade with counterfeit tokens in pools that shouldn't exist.\nWhen your emergency response involves asking nicely for help, who's really conducting this orchestra of chaos?\nGriffin AI's $3 million vanishing act reads like a DeFi déjà vu fever dream.\nAdmin keys turned into weapons. Cross-chain bridges became counterfeiting machines.\nAnother day, another reminder that your biggest threat might be checking email while holding the master keys.\nHours before everything went to hell,traders were riding GAIN's \"price-discovery tear\" with $109.8 million in launch volume, hyping the \"high-momentum move\" toward $0.20 resistance.\nBy the next morning, those same momentum chasers were staring at a 90% crater where their portfolios used to be.\nThe script feels painfully familiar: UXLink's multisig betrayal cost users $41 million just days ago, proving that whether it's LayerZero peers or delegateCall functions, administrative access keeps morphing into exit ramps.\nEven more fitting -the Griffin AI exploiter later minted trillions fake UXLink tokens in three separate transactionsusing acounterfeit contract created on September 23rd.\nBecause apparently when you're running a counterfeiting operation, why not counterfeit the other counterfeiters too.\nGriffin AI's founder took rare ownership of the failure, but accountability doesn't resurrect dead tokenomics or explain how cross-chain trust mechanisms become counterfeiting operations overnight.\nThe 4.85 billion phantom tokensstill sitting in the attacker's walletserve as a constant reminder that this story isn't over - just paused.\nMaybe the real exploit was the friends we trusted with admin keys along the way.\nWhen your biggest security risk sits in the boardroom instead of the codebase, what exactly are we auditing?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

They built a trap with moving parts.\nBubblemaps traced what might be crypto's largest Sybil attack. One entity. 100 wallets.9.8 million MYX tokens worth $170 million.\nEvery wallet told the same story:funded through OKX on April 19 at exactly 6:50 AM, loaded with identical BNB amounts, thenclaimed tokens in perfect synchronization on May 7 at 5:30 AM.\nNo prior activityand no legitimate reason to exist beyond gaming the distribution.\nWhile retail traders scrambled to qualify for crumbs, insiders had already baked themselves a $170 million cake.\nDaily perpetualvolume hit $6-9 billion.\nFor context, that's multiple times larger than MYX's entire market cap. Organic markets don't work that way.\nSynchronized trading patternsacross Binance, PancakeSwap, and Bitget painted a clear picture: bots talking to bots while retail watched the numbers climb.\nSmall trades flowed into central wallets like water finding the same drain.\nReal trading volume has personality - messy, inconsistent, human.\nThis had none of that. Just algorithmic precision designed to create FOMO while retail provided the exit liquidity.\nWhen your daily trading volume exceeds your market cap by orders of magnitude, are you running an exchange or a money printer?\nMYX knew how to hurt people.\nPush spot price above $3.69 and watch the dominoes fall -$73 million in shorts liquidated over 48 hours.\nWith 50x leverage available, retail didn't need much rope to hang themselves.\nBinance's hourlyfunding rate settlements on MYX perpetualsmade life even worse for shorts.\nMore frequent settlements meant higher costs for shorts and more opportunities to squeeze them out.\nWhat looked like an exchange policy was actually ammunition for the manipulation.\nWhen shorts got liquidated, they had to buy back their positions. Forced buying pushed prices higher, liquidated more shorts, created more forced buying.\nThe worst single day (September 8th)saw $42 million in shorts disappear, part of the $73 million liquidated across 48 hours.\nPerfect timing doesn't exist in organic markets, but it was everywhere in MYX's operation.\nJust as the token hit peak hype,39 million tokens unlocked- about 3.9% of total supply flooding the market exactly when retail demand peaked.\nHack VC didn't waste time. Theymoved 835,000 MYX tokens straight to MEXC, ready to dump into the buying frenzy they'd helped create.\nThis wasn't a coincidence. This was choreography.\nBut what happens when the mathematical proof becomes so damning that denial isn't an option?\nMYX Finance faced a choice: deny everything or own the manipulation.\nThey chose door number three - admit it and claim it was totally fine.\nTheir September 9 responseread like a legal document written by someone who'd never heard of public relations.\n\"Apart from the Cambrian campaign, where anti-sybil measures were applied,\"they wrote, \"all other campaign rewards have been strictly based on users' genuine trading volume and LP contributions, without any additional restrictions.\"\nTranslation: We knew about the Sybil attack and we're cool with it.\nTheir response got worse: \"Prior to launch, some users requested to change their addresses, including a number of high-volume participants.\nFrom the perspective of focusing on trading itself, we did not impose specific prohibitions on such requests.\"\nThey called100 freshly funded wallets claiming $170 million\"address changes.\"\nThey framed systematic airdrop manipulation as user-friendly customer service.\nBut the real kicker came next: \"Even in cases where a single entity participates extensively, we acknowledge and respect that participation.\"\nMYX Finance just admitted theylet one entity claim 1% of their token supply through a coordinated Sybil attack.\nThey didn't deny it happened. They didn't apologize for it. They defended it as legitimate user engagement.\nBubblemaps wasn't buying it.They called the explanation\"a long, vague GPT-reply\" and pressed for answers about wallet coordination and team connections. MYX Finance never provided them.\nWhen your defense strategy involves admitting to the crime, maybe the strategy needs work?\nMYX's valuation made about as much sense as a chocolate teapot.\nAt its peak,MYX appeared to have over $17 billion in fully diluted valuation.\nFor comparison, Hyperliquid - the current king of decentralized perps - sits at similar numbers but with $712 million in TVL and $12.8 billion in open interest.\nMYX? $55 million TVL. $5 million open interest.\nMYX's price spike wasn't matched by significant increases in social chatter or organic community growth,indicating much of the move was trader-driven rather than based on genuine user adoption.\nYet somehow the token kept pumping.\nWith 80% of supply locked up and only 197 million tokens actually trading, MYX created perfect conditions for price manipulation.\nLow float plus insider control equals whatever price the controllers want.\nThe technical indicators screamed danger.RSI hit 98.06- levels so overbought that seasoned traders started building short positions just to fade the insanity.\nBid-ask spreads contracted when they should have widened during illiquidity events.\nGate exchange recorded32 separate liquidity anomalies in 48 hours.\nNone of this mattered to retail. They saw green candles and bought anyway.\nWhen fundamentals and technicals both point toward manipulation, but the price keeps rising, who's really controlling the market?\nReality caught up fast.MYX peaked at $19.03 on September 11before gravity remembered how to work.\nTwo weeks later,the token trades around $9- a 52% haircut that wiped out billions in paper gains.\nThe crash followed thesame pattern as MYX's August rehearsal: massive pump followed by savage dump.\nRetail who bought the hype learned the same lesson twice - insiders control the exit doors and they always leave first.\nTrading volume collapsed alongside the price. The wash trading bots went quiet once the extraction was complete.\nDaily volumes that once hit hundreds of millions shrunk to pocket change as artificial demand evaporated.\nPlatform metrics told the real story.\nWith just $55 million in TVL and $5 million in open interest while claiming a $17.7 billion valuation, the numbers didn't add up.\nRevenue? Practically nothing. Marketing claims? Sky high.\nMYX built a casino where the house always won because the house owned all the cards.\nSeveral analysts who called the manipulationearly started building short positions during the peak.\nThey recognized the pattern from previous pump schemes and positioned accordingly.\nRetail, meanwhile, kept buying the dip that kept dipping.\nThe Bubblemaps investigation gained traction as the price fell.\nMore researchers began digging into MYX's wallet connections and airdrop distribution.\nEach new finding reinforced the original thesis: this was engineered extraction, not organic growth.\nBut will this mathematical proof of manipulation actually change anything?\nMYX Finance didn't just manipulate markets - they perfected the art of statistical fraud in broad daylight.\nFour coordinated attack vectors, mathematical proof of impossibility, and an official response that doubled down on the deception.\nMYX extracted $170 million through the largest airdrop Sybil attack in crypto history while retail investors provided exit liquidity for a scheme disguised as innovation.\nThe beauty of their operation wasn't the sophistication - it was the brazenness.\nThey admitted to everything and claimed it was policy, not crime.\nWhile analysts warned about RSI levels above 98 and volume patterns that defied physics, retail kept buying into the hype machine.\nMYX now trades at around $9, down 52% from $19.03, while the math behind the scam lives forever on-chain.\nThe kill-box worked perfectly - retail got trapped, insiders got paid, and gravity eventually won.\nWhen fraud this blatant still pays out hundreds of millions, what's the point of building anything real?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

    "text": "Shibarium-Validator Compromise-Rekt\nRonin's ghost haunts the validator landscape once again.\nSeptember 12th brought a familiar nightmare to Shibarium - attackers seizing control of 10 out of 12 validator keys, similar to how the North Korean hackers did todrain $624 million from Ronin Bridge in 2022.\nFlash loans met validator capture in a $3 million heist that exposed the brittle trust assumptions underlying cross-chain bridges.\nWhile BONE holders celebrated pump prices, the attacker was busy rewriting the rules of Shibarium's consensus reality.\nNo smart contract bugs, no protocol vulnerabilities - just someone who figured out that controlling the validators means owning the network.\nShiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya called it: “a sophisticated, probably planned for months attack”, but the blockchain called it exactly what the code allowed.\nWhen your bridge security depends on an honest majority, what happens when dishonesty becomes the majority?\nPeckShield caught the first whiffof blood in the water.\nLate evening September 12th, the security firmflagged suspicious validator activity to Shytoshi Kusama: \"Hi ShytoshiKusama, you may want to take a look\" - complete with transaction hash evidence of the unfolding disaster.\nAlmost 12 hours later, Shiba Inu developerKaal Dhairya surfaced with damage control mode activated.\nHis announcement revealed the uncomfortable truth: \"We are currently in damage control mode and do not yet know if the breach originated from a server or a developer machine.\"\nTheattacker took control of the validator keys, gained majority power, and authorized a malicious state to drain the bridge.\nBy early morning September 13th, theShibarium damage control playbook was in full swing: \"Was Shibarium hacked? No. The protocol itself was not compromised.\"\nClassic crypto crisis management - reframe the narrative before the community fully grasps what happened.\nBut the blockchain doesn't care about PR spin, and the numbers told a different story entirely.\nWhen your crisis response sounds more like a courtroom defense than a security update, who are you really trying to convince?\nShibarium's security model was built on a house of cards - and someone finally huffed and puffed hard enough to blow it down.\nThe attack vector was elegantly simple: gain control of enough validators to rewrite consensus reality.\nShibarium operates with just 12 validators, requiring only 8 signatures (two-thirds majority) to approve state checkpoints.\nThe attacker managed tocompromise 10 of those 12 signing keys, leaving onlyK9 FinanceandUnificationvalidators refusing to play along with the charade.\nFlash loansprovided the capital injection needed to acquire 4.6 million BONE tokens, temporarily granting the attacker validator voting power within the same block as the exploit.\nNo complex smart contract gymnastics required - just convince the network that theft equals legitimate consensus.\nMr. Lightspeed's analysis revealed the brutal simplicity: the attacker used bridge funds in the same block to buy BONE, delegate it for validator power, sign fraudulent checkpoints, then repay the \"loan\" with the stolen assets.\nA perfect closed loop that turned Shibarium's own mechanics against itself.\nL2BEAT had already flagged this exact scenarioas Shibarium's Achilles heel: \"Funds can be stolen if validators submit a fraudulent checkpoint allowing themselves to withdraw all locked funds.\"\nThe warning was there in black and white, a prophecy written in risk assessments that appeared to be ignored.\nShibarium's bridge operates without validity proofs or fraud detection - if enough validators sign off, Ethereum's contracts obediently release the funds.\nCode is law, even when the law is being written by criminals.\nWhen your security depends on trusting the majority, what happens when the majority can be bought for the price of a flash loan?\nThe blockchain never lies, even when everyone else is spinning damage control narratives.\nTwo transactions paint the picture of Shibarium's $3 million bleeding - methodical execution that screams advance planning over lucky timing.\nAttacker’s Address:0x999E025a2a0558c07DBf7F021b2C9852B367e80A\nAttack Transaction 1:0xe882a83afb92d6070b848ef025ae699ec043b7c2f31b21d2a08c94306f9b817e\n72.6 billion SHIB ($948k)\n4.6 million BONE staking operations\n216.39 WETH ($975k)\nAttack Transaction 2:0x6df7dcb5dac11355926abf2d9490af031619900de2e202dc780765222101007a\n248.9 billion KNINE ($631k)\n29,167 LEASH ($490k)\n32 million ROAR ($347k)\n34.3 million TREAT ($47k)\n21,094 USDC ($21k)\n16,183 USDT ($16k)\n2.06 trillion BAD ($16k)\n860 million SHIFU ($9k)\n361k FUND (~$9k)\nWhat happened next turned the exploit into an expensive game of digital whack-a-mole.\nK9 Finance DAO blacklistedthe attacker's address,blocking the sale of 248.9 billion KNINE tokensworth around $700,000.\nPlot twist -almost half the haul got completely screwed.\nBlacklisted tokens and locked stake equal dead money.\nPerfect crime, terrible execution.\nStealing $3 million is impressive, but what's the point when $1.3 million of it becomes digital museum pieces that nobody can touch?\nBONE holders got front-row seatsto exploit economics - abrutal 122% pumpfollowed by an even more brutal reality check.\nThe token rocketed from $0.166 to $0.37 on MEXCas traders mistook validator capture for bullish fundamentals. Flash loan demand created artificial scarcity while the actual network burned - peak crypto moment right there.\nThe comedown was swift and merciless.BONE crashed 43.5% from monthly highs,SHIB dropped 11.5%, andKNINE fell 10%. Only the blacklisted tokens kept their \"value\" - worthless numbers that looked pretty on block explorers.\nShibarium's responseread like a hostage negotiation:\"We are open to negotiating in good faith with the attacker: if the funds are returned, we will not press any charges and are willing to consider a small bounty.\" Nothing says we're in control, quite like offering to pay the guy who just robbed you.\nK9 Finance took a more direct approach,sending anon-chain messageoffering5 ETH ($23,000)for the return of their trapped KNINE tokens.\nWhile most of the community split between denial and anger, one researcher asked the questions that mattered.\nMr. Lightspeed cut straight to the uncomfortable truth, addressing K9 Finance and Unification - the only two validators who refused to sign the malicious checkpoint:\n\"Let me guess: you two set up your own validators independently - no outside assistance? Skill set is there. If the others had central help, then all the other keys may belong to one person? That then points to a governance key / signing compromise connected to one person. That would also mean that decentralization was an illusion.\"\nWhen the only validators acting independently are the ones who refuse to sign your malicious checkpoint, what does that tell you about your \"decentralized\" network?\nIf decentralization is just theater and one person controls most of the keys, are we securing DeFi or just building elaborate honeypots?\nSo here we are, wrapping up another disasterpiece.\nShibarium just got schooled bya similar lesson that destroyed Ronin- put your faith in validator honesty and watch someone buy their way to a $3 million withdrawal.\nNo code breaking required, no smart contract wizardry needed. Just enough compromised validators to make theft look like consensus.\nL2BEAT practically drew them a roadmap to the vault, warning in black and white that fraudulent checkpoints could drain everything.\nProphecy met profit when someone finally bothered to read the fine print.\nCrime meets punishment in crypto's strangest way - half the loot sits frozen forever, trapped by blacklists and staking mechanics.\nK9 Finance turned their tokens into digital cement, while unbonding delays locked the BONE in validator jail. Sometimes the best security happens after you've already been robbed.\nAll the PR spin can't hide what really happened here.\nShibarium's bridge worked exactly like it was supposed to - the fatal flaw was building it that way in the first place.\nWhen your security model treats consensus as truth instead of verifying it, how long before the next validator majority gets bought and paid for?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

    "text": "Bunnie-Rekt-Rounding Bug\nOne precision bug. Two pools. $8.4 million gone.\nBunni thought they'd cracked the code with their custom Liquidity Distribution Function - some next-level math that would squeeze every drop of profit from Uniswap V4.\nTurned out they'd just built themselves a very expensive calculator that someone else learned to break.\nOn September 1st, an attacker turned pocket change into an $8.4 million payday by exploiting Bunni's rebalancing logic across Ethereum and Unichain.\nNo flash loans needed. No oracle manipulation required.\nJust carefully sized trades that broke the math at exactly the right moments, allowing repeated withdrawals that drained pools faster than you could say \"liquidity provider.\"\nBlockSec sounded the alarm, but by then millions were alreadycrossing bridges to Ethereum in tidy 100 ETH chunks.\nBunni hit the emergency pause button across all networks, but the vault was already empty.\nWhen your protocol's greatest innovation becomes your fatal flaw, who's really doing the math?\nBlockSec fired the first shot late on September 1st, flagging suspicious transactions targeting Bunni's Ethereum contracts with losses around $2.3 million.\nAn hour later, the damage assessment exploded.CertiK identified the same exploit pattern on Unichain, pushing total losses to $8.4 million across both networks.\nHalf the stolen Unichain funds hadalready been swapped to ETH and were bridging to Ethereum through Across Protocol in methodical 100 ETH transfers.\nBunni's acknowledgmentcame two hours after BlockSec's initial alert.\nTheir response was textbook damage control: \"The Bunni app has been affected by a security exploit. As a precaution, we have paused all smart contract functions on all networks.\"\nAbout 4 hours later, Bunni had narrowed the blast radius,confirming only two pools were compromised: USDC/USDT on Ethereum and ETH/weETH on Unichain.\nSilent P from Bunni announced a pause on all contracts, while they assembled a war room with Hypernative, Cyfrin Audits, Impossible, and BlockSec.\nAll hands on deck, but the horse had already bolted.\nBut how exactly do you turn a few precisely timed trades into an eight-figure heist?\nBunni got rekt by their own cleverness.\nMost DEXes stick with Uniswap's battle-tested logic.\nNot Bunni.They cooked up their own mathematical masterpiece- a custom Liquidity Distribution Function that would milk maximum profits from every trade.\nTheLDF lived to optimize liquidity distribution, withswaps triggering rebalancing when token ratios deviate significantly from targets.\nSpot a deviation and boom - time to recalculate and rebalance to keep those token ratios looking pretty.\nVictor Tran from KyberSwapfigured out what went wrong: someone discovered they could game this LDF with trades of very specific sizes.\nThese precision strikes broke the rebalancing math, causing it to spit out completely wrong calculations for how much each LP share was worth.\nThe attacker just kept hitting replay - withdrawing more tokens than they should have, cycle after cycle.\nEach round made the error nastier, turning rounding mistakes into cold hard cash.\nWilliam Li spotted the smoking gun: the attacker had drained one balance down to a measly 25 wei.\nWhen you're dividing by numbers that small, precision goes out the window and the math falls apart.\nBest part?The attacker left over 1,000 logs in their transactions, complete withhelpful markers like\"Depositing to euler\" and \"Unlock Callback.\"\nBasically wrote themselves a how-to guide while robbing the place.\nWhen your rebalancing mechanism becomes someone else's money printer, who's watching the watchers?\nThe attacker didn't materialize out of thin air with $8.4 million.\nTime to follow the breadcrumbs.\nPrimary Attacker on Ethereum:0x0C3d8fA7762Ca5225260039ab2d3990C035B458D\nPrimary Attacker on Unichain:0x0C3d8fA7762Ca5225260039ab2d3990C035B458D\nAttack Contract on Ethereum:0x657D8BcCDD9C6e1Da8DA1e7d331CFdeA8357AdBc\nAttack Contract on Unichain:0x6F559f75ba08d7f45a344E12ECBe8BC15A700DdA\nAttack Transactions as follows…\nEthereum:0x1c27c4d625429acfc0f97e466eda725fd09ebdc77550e529ba4cbdbc33beb97b\nUnichain:0x4776f31156501dd456664cd3c91662ac8acc78358b9d4fd79337211eb6a1d451\nTwo Ethereum wallets caught the loot:0xe04efd87f410e260cf940a3bcb8bc61f33464f2b0x18a0Aa63C07534f69aD626E6F72f20Cbe5969263\nThe heist played out in two acts.\nFirst,$2.4 million drainedfrom Ethereum's USDC/USDT pool.\nThen$6 million vanishedfromUnichain's ETH/weETH pool- because why stop at one network when you can double down?\nHalf the Unichain haul got immediately swapped to ETHand started its journey to Ethereum via Across Protocol.\nNot all at once though - the attacker was methodical,bridging funds in neat 100 ETH chunkslike they were following some money laundering manual.\nBy the time security firms finished tallying the damage, most of the funds were already consolidated on Ethereum, sitting pretty in those two addresses while Bunni scrambled to figure out what the hell just happened.\nWhen precision errors pay better than most day jobs, who needs a resume?\nHere's where things get messy.\nWho caught what when becomes a tangle of timelines and audit scope questions - the kind of complexity that makes post-mortems messy.\nBunni wasn't some garage operation cutting corners on security. They got themselvesaudited by legit firms.\nTrail of Bits (January 2025):Caught precision issues dead-on, flagged TOB-BUNNI-13 about \"lack of systematic approach to rounding and arithmetic errors\" plus TOB-BUNNI-9 on excess liquidity manipulation.\nAccording to the advice in their audit,Trail of Bits told them to fix their rounding and add more fuzzing. Repo history shows code kept changing before, during, and after their review.\nPashov Audit Group (August-September 2024):Earlier comprehensive review, found 45 issues including 6 critical ones. Code changes kept happening after they finished up.\nCyfrin (June 2025 - Main Audit):This is where things get complicated.\nIn response to Rekt News inquiries, Cyfrin confirmed they found 50+ issues and basically said 'Considering the number of issues identified, it is statistically likely that there are more complex bugs still present... it is recommended that a follow-up audit and development of a more complex stateful fuzz test suite be undertaken prior to continuing to deploy significant monetary capital to production.'\nCyfrin didn't catch the specific rounding bug, but they called the bigger picture - essentially warning Bunni that more bugs were likely hiding and not to scale without additional security work.\nCyfrin (July 2025 - Fee Override Hooklet):Totally different scope, just covered fee stuff. Withdrawal logic wasn't even on their radar.\nWhich leads us to a Move Fast and Break Things Problem.\nCyfrin essentially handed Bunni a roadmap to prevent getting rekt: don't scale until you've done more security work.\nThe protocol had already deployed, but the recommendation was clear - additional audits before continuing to deploy significant monetary capital.\nBunni chose speed over security.\nTVL exploded from $2.4M to $23.9M overnight(July 31st to August 1st) following Cyfrin's audit instead of following their recommendations for additional security measures.\nThe result? An exploit by exactly the type of \"complex bug\" Cyfrin predicted would exist.\nThe Technical Reality (FromBunni's Own Post-Mortem):\nThe exploit wasn't some theoretical edge case - it was a sophisticated three-step attack that Bunni's own analysis confirms could have been prevented with better testing frameworks.\nThe attack involved manipulating tiny withdrawals to exploit rounding errors, decreasing USDC active balance from 28 wei to 4 wei - an 85.7% decrease disproportionate to the liquidity shares being burnt.\nBunni admits their existing testing framework failed: \"We have Foundry unit tests and fuzz tests as well as Medusa fuzz tests, but they did not cover the scenario that occurred during the exploit\".\nWhat actually broke? Rounding that looked fine by itself turned lethal when chained together. Cyfrin literally called this shot.\nPost-Exploit Confirmation:\nAfter getting rekt,Cyfrin dropped a detailed breakdownof exactly how the exploit worked.\nAwkward timing, considering they'd just spent June telling Bunni that complex bugs were lurking and more security work was needed before scaling.\nThe firm that predicted hidden complex vulnerabilities ended up reverse-engineering the exact complex vulnerability they warned about.\nThis wasn't an audit oopsie - Bunni made a business call to ignore explicit warnings about sophisticated bugs still hiding in their code.\nCyfrin's post-hack analysisbasically confirmed their own June prediction: safe-looking code can hide nasty edge cases when operations get chained together.\nMoral of the story: When security firms tell you complex bugs are probably still there, maybe don't YOLO into higher TVL?\nMath is a bitch in DeFi.\nBunni thought they were building the future of liquidity optimization.\nTurns out they were just building an $8.4 million lesson in why you don't mess with formulas that already work.\nUniswap V4 gave them rock-solid infrastructure, but Bunni's custom LDF became their own weapon of mass destruction.\nThe exploiter came armed with nothing but basic math and infinite patience, turning rounding errors into retirement money.\nMultiple audit firms gave their blessing, yet somehow a precision bug that any decent analyst could spot in the transaction logs sailed right past everyone.\nBunni joins the growing pile of protocols that got too smart for their own good, proving yet again that innovation without bulletproof math is just expensive trial and error.\nWhen decimals decide who gets rekt and who gets rich, why gamble on reinventing wheels that already roll?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The blockchain had already contained $41.5 million in the attacker's address hours earlier.\nCEO Cyrus SwissBorg called itan \"an external DeFi wallet held with a counterparty.\"Kiln called it\"unauthorized access.\" Neither wanted to say the word everyone was thinking: hack.\nThere's something fitting about the name though.\nA kiln is a furnace- once you fire clay, the shape hardens forever, cracks and all.\nSwissBorg put their faith in Kiln to harden their staking infrastructure. Instead, that furnace cooked their security brittle, exposing every flaw.\nThe attackers didn't crack SwissBorg's vaults or exploit their smart contracts.\nThey compromised Kiln's API- the digital bridge connecting SwissBorg's funds to Solana's staking network.\nEight days before the heist,an unstaking transactionthat looked completely routine actually contained a nasty surprise.\nWhile deactivating 975.33 SOL worth roughly $200k, the same transaction secretly included eight separate authorization instructions that transferred withdrawal authority from SwissBorg's legitimate controllers to \"SwissBorg Exploiter 1\" across multiple stake accounts.\nThe transaction appeared to be standard unstaking operations - the kind that happen hundreds of times daily across Solana.\nBut buried in those routine instructions was the skeleton key that would unlock $41.5 million eight days later.\nSkeleton Key Transaction:5DCPDEVrnVdM4jHgxYGtuuzvSubg15sSpkBCxexfuApRAfXEmNfokiTyj6bxE52QNGVbPnwm9L3YzcEoMHHEpLV\nBlockchain security researcherChaofan Shou called it \"Bybit hack V2\"- and the comparison fits.\nJust like Bybit's attackers hid malicious control transfers inside legitimate-looking UI transactions, SwissBorg's thieves buried their authority grab inside what appeared to be normal unstaking operations.\nKiln's statement read like corporate Mad Libs - generic crisis management boilerplate designed not to spook institutional clients while $41.5 million walked out the back door.\nWhen your partner's furnace burns down your security instead of hardening it, who's really getting fired?\nEight days of patience, then chaos in minutes.\nSeptember 8th, 9:00 AM UTC. The thieves finally activated their skeleton key, draining 192,600 SOL faster than SwissBorg could spell incident response.\nThe stolen funds landed in this wallet address that Solscan now helpfully labels \"SwissBorg Exploiter 1.\"\nSwissBorg Exploiter 1:TYFWG3hvvxWMs2KXEk8cDuJCsXEyKs65eeqpD9P4mK1\nBut these weren't amateur hour thieves looking to dump everything on the nearest DEX.\nThey split their strategy into two distinct operations.\nThe attacker moved 189,524 SOL ($40.7 million) in one massive transfer to another wallet, where it's been sitting untouched ever since.\nTransaction:5Es6C4oT2SDXaE86P2KUCAJVfdRvfSv8oEMvtJtwsatJcFJ75BxYh4SbjBMEca6voKkc8Pc2Ja1wNE7CHmf3mUx5\nMost of the stolen funds are here ($40,7 million):2dmoNLgfP1UjqM9ZxtTqWY1YJMHJdXnUkwTrcLhL7Xoq\nMeanwhile, a much smaller 1,000 SOL started its own journey through a chain of wallet-hopping from the original exploiter address.\nSwissBorg Exploiter 1:TYFWG3hvvxWMs2KXEk8cDuJCsXEyKs65eeqpD9P4mK1\nMultiple transfers across multiple addresses, with funds continuing to split and move in an endless shell game - the kind of movement pattern that screams \"professional money laundering operation.\"\nThe big pile stays put while the small batch tests the waters.\nSmart risk management from people who understand that moving $40 million at once is a great way to attract every blockchain investigator on the planet.\nPeckShield eventually caught them testing exchange waterswith a 100 SOL deposit to Bitget - but the path to get there revealed just how methodical these thieves really were.

When you outsource security, you're still outsourcing risk to your users' wallets.\nSwissBorg immediately deployed the usual post-hack cavalry:white-hat hackers and security partnersto recover compromised funds, whilethanking blockchain investigators and security firmsfor their collaboration in tracking down funds that were probably already being split into untraceable fragments.\nTheplatform paused Solana staking transactionswhilehighlighting that the“SwissBorg app remains fully secure and all other funds in Earn programs are 100% safe.”\nBecause nothing inspires confidence quite like selective service shutdowns after a massive theft.\nKiln, meanwhile, went full lockdown mode,disabling their dashboard, widget, and APIsuntil they could figure out how hackers had turned their infrastructure into a $41.5 million withdrawal service.\nWhen your partner's response is 'turn everything off until we figure out what happened,' how exactly does that qualify as professional partnership?\nSwissBorg survived their $41.5 million Monday, but the bill came with more than just treasury depletion.\nEight days of patience, one skeleton key transaction, and suddenly \"institutional-grade custody\" looked about as trustworthy as a house of cards in a hurricane.\nThe Swiss platform learned the hard way that your security is only as strong as your weakest API endpoint - and that endpoint belonged to someone else.\nKiln got to keep their \"enterprise-grade staking\" marketing while SwissBorg got to keep the $41.5 million invoice.\nThe thieves got to keep most of their SOL sitting in digital storage, probably laughing at how a few authorization instructions buried in routine unstaking operations had unlocked institutional treasure.\nUsers got their promise of full compensation, but promises don't erase the fundamental problem: when you trust partners to handle withdrawal keys, you're not running a custody service - you're running a very expensive trust exercise.\nThe blockchain never lies, but the people building on top of it sure know how to spin a good story about \"contained incidents\" and \"external counterparties.\"\nSwissBorg will rebuild, Kiln will patch their systems, and the crypto world will move on to the next spectacular failure of operational security masquerading as institutional innovation.\nIf crypto was built to eliminate trusted third parties, why do we keep handing our keys to the exact institutions that prove they don't deserve them?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate(ETH / ERC20):0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer:\nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.
